# Resilient Functions Integration to Slack

This function creates a Slack message based on a Resilient Incident, it's Tasks, Notes, Artifacts and Attachments.

Many of the features of posting a Slack message are under customer control including:
- Creating private or public channels
- Inviting users to conversations
- Preserving embedded links
- Posting messages from Incidents, Notes, Artifacts and Tasks displaying authorship
- Uploading Incident, Task or Artifact attachment
- Slack user ID <@U345GHIJKL> and channel ID #C012ABCDE references
- Exporting conversation history to a text file, saving it as an Attachment in Resilient and archiving Slack channel
