# Resilient Functions for CarbonBlack Protection

This Resilient Function package can be used to interact with Carbon Black CbProtection.
When a CbProtection user sends an approval request to allow execution of a file,
this request can be used to create a Resilient incident.  This integration includes
workflows for the analyst to approve or deny the approval request.

Prerequisites:

	resilient version 30 or later
	resilient_circuits version 30 or later

## Environment

This package requires that it is installed on a RHEL platform and that the resilient-circuits application is installed.
Install this package with 'pip', or `python setup.py install`.
To set the config values in the app.config file with a new resilient instance run `resilient-circuits config -c`.
To set the config values in the app.config file with an existing resilient instance run `resilient-circuits config -u`.

Config values example:

	[fn_cb_protection]
	
	# Name or IP address of your CbProtect server
	server=10.200.1.1
	
	# Access token issued by the CbProtect administrator
	token=XXXXX-XXXX-XXXXX-XXXX
	
	# If your CbProtect server has a self-signed TLS certificate, you cannot verify it:
	# verify_cert=false
	
	# Interval (seconds) for automatic escalation of approval requests, set 0 to disable
	# Suggest 300 as a starting point, which will check CbProtect every 5 minutes
	escalation_interval=0
	
	# Optional: query for which requests to escalate; default is to escalate all open approval requests
	# escalation_query=resolution:0
	
	# Optional: path to a custom template file for the escalated incident
	# template_file=/usr/integration/bit9_escalation.jinja
	
	# Optional: set this to only escalate a single request ID, e.g. when testing a custom template
	# test_single_request=999


Run with: `resilient-circuits run`.
