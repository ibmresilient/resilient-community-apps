**Amazon AWS GuardDuty Integration for Resilient.**

 ![screenshot: main](./doc/screenshots/main.png)

Amazon AWS GuardDuty is a continuous security monitoring service that identifies unexpected and potentially unauthorized and malicious activity within an AWS environment. 
GuardDuty informs the user of the status of their AWS environment by producing security findings that can be viewed in the GuardDuty console.
A finding is a potential security issue discovered by GuardDuty.

The Amazon AWS GuardDuty Integration for Resilient allows you to process and respond to GuardDuty findings within the IBM Resilient Platform.
        
### Key Features
<!--
  List the Key Features of the Integration
-->
The GuardDuty Integration provides the following functionality:
* A poller which gathers current findings from GuardDuty and escalates to the Resilient platform as incidents.
* A function to archive a GuardDuty finding when the corresponding Resilient incident is closed.
* A function to refresh a Resilient incident with the latest information from the corresponding GuardDuty finding.
* Close Resilient incidents if the corresponding GuardDuty findings are archived.
* Archive GuardDuty findings if the corresponding Resilient incidents are closed.
* Trigger a refresh for a Resilient incident if the corresponding GuardDuty finding gets updated. 
* A refresh of Resilient incidents can be executed manually.
---

## Requirements
<!--
  List any Requirements 
-->
This app supports the IBM Resilient SOAR Platform and the IBM Cloud Pak for Security.

### Resilient platform
The Resilient platform supports two app deployment mechanisms, App Host and integration server.

If deploying to a Resilient platform with an App Host, the requirements are:
* Resilient platform >= `39.0.6328`.
* The app is in a container-based format (available from the AppExchange as a `zip` file).

If deploying to a Resilient platform with an integration server, the requirements are:
* Resilient platform >= `39.0.6328`.
* The app is in the older integration format (available from the AppExchange as a `zip` file which contains a `tar.gz` file).
* Integration server is running `resilient_circuits>=35.0.0,<v39.0.0`.
* If using an API key account, make sure the account provides the following minimum permissions: 
  | Name | Permissions |
  | ---- | ----------- |
  | Org Data | Read |
  | Function | Read |
  | incident | create |
  | all_incidents | Read |

The following Resilient platform guides provide additional information: 
* _App Host Deployment Guide_: provides installation, configuration, and troubleshooting information, including proxy server settings. 
* _Integration Server Guide_: provides installation, configuration, and troubleshooting information, including proxy server settings.
* _System Administrator Guide_: provides the procedure to install, configure and deploy apps. 

The above guides are available on the IBM Knowledge Center at [ibm.biz/resilient-docs](https://ibm.biz/resilient-docs). On this web page, select your Resilient platform version. On the follow-on page, you can find the _App Host Deployment Guide_ or _Integration Server Guide_ by expanding **Resilient Apps** in the Table of Contents pane. The System Administrator Guide is available by expanding **System Administrator**.

### Cloud Pak for Security
If you are deploying to IBM Cloud Pak for Security, the requirements are:
* IBM Cloud Pak for Security >= 1.4.
* Cloud Pak is configured with an App Host.
* The app is in a container-based format (available from the AppExchange as a `zip` file).

The following Cloud Pak guides provide additional information: 
* _App Host Deployment Guide_: provides installation, configuration, and troubleshooting information, including proxy server settings. From the Table of Contents, select Case Management and Orchestration & Automation > **Orchestration and Automation Apps**.
* _System Administrator Guide_: provides information to install, configure, and deploy apps. From the IBM Cloud Pak for Security Knowledge Center table of contents, select Case Management and Orchestration & Automation > **System administrator**.

These guides are available on the IBM Knowledge Center at [ibm.biz/cp4s-docs](https://ibm.biz/cp4s-docs). From this web page, select your IBM Cloud Pak for Security version. From the version-specific Knowledge Center page, select Case Management and Orchestration & Automation.

### Proxy Server
The app **does** support a proxy server.

---

## Installation

### Install
* To install or uninstall an App or Integration on the _Resilient platform_, see the documentation at [ibm.biz/resilient-docs](https://ibm.biz/resilient-docs).
* To install or uninstall an App on _IBM Cloud Pak for Security_, see the documentation at [ibm.biz/cp4s-docs](https://ibm.biz/cp4s-docs) and follow the instructions above to navigate to Orchestration and Automation.

### App Configuration
The following table provides the settings you need to configure the app. These settings are made in the app.config file. See the documentation discussed in the Requirements section for the procedure.

| **aws_gd_lookback_interval** | No | `60` | *How long, (in minutes) to check back for previous findings at startup. Filter to process only more recent findings.* |
| **aws_gd_close_incident_template** | No | `` | *User defined JSON template file to use for closing Resilient incidents.* |
| **http_proxy** | No | `http://proxy:80` | *Optional setting for an http proxy if required.*  |
| **https_proxy** | No | `https://proxy:443` | *Optional setting for an https proxy if required.* |

### Custom Layouts
<!--
  Use this section to provide guidance on where the user should add any custom fields and data tables.
  You may wish to recommend a new incident tab.
  You should save a screenshot "custom_layouts.png" in the doc/screenshots directory and reference it here
-->
Import the Data Tables and Custom Fields as shown in the screenshot below.

Configure the Incident Details tab layout to display the AWS GuardDuty information as follows:
1. Navigate to the ‘Customization Settings’ and select the Layouts tab.
2. Click on ‘Incident Tabs’.
3. Create new heading 'AWS GuardDuty Properties' in the Details tab.
4. Drag and Drop the GuardDuty custom properties under the new heading.

The following screenshot shows the GuardDuty fields added to the Details tab.

  ![screenshot: custom_layouts_fields](./doc/screenshots/custom_layouts_fields.png)


5. Add a new incident tab named ‘AWS GuardDuty Details’.
6. Drag and drop the GuardDuty data tables under the new tab.
7. Click Save.

The following screenshot shows the GuardDuty data tables added to the GuardDuty tab:

  ![screenshot: custom_layouts_datatables](./doc/screenshots/custom_layouts_datatables.png)

---
## Poller - AWS GuardDuty: Escalate Findings
The GuardDuty integration poller starts querying GuardDuty for findings as soon as the app begins running.

The poller provide the following functionality.

* For any new findings discovered, creates a  matching incident in the Resilient platform. 
* Enhances the incidents by adding artifacts, data tables and a note with data from the findings. The note includes the JSON content of the finding.
* Can be configured to filter the findings, which are escalated to the Resilient incidents.  
* Closes Resilient incidents if the corresponding GuardDuty findings are archived.
* Archives GuardDuty findings if the corresponding Resilient incidents are closed.
* Triggers a refresh of GuardDuty information for a Resilient incident if the corresponding GuardDuty finding is updated.

The following screenshot shows examples of Resilient incidents created by the poller from GuardDuty findings:

## Function - AWS GuardDuty: Archive finding
Resilient function to archive an AWS GuardDuty finding when the corresponding incident is closed.

  ![screenshot: fn-aws-guardduty-archive-finding](./doc/screenshots/fn-aws-guardduty-archive-finding.png)

The function provides the following functionality.

* When a Resilient incident corresponding to a GuardDuty find is closed, an automatic rule `Example: AWS GuardDuty: Archive Finding` is triggered which executes the function.
* Archives the related GuardDuty finding.
* Adds a note to the Resilient incident.

The following screenshot shows an example of a note added to a Resilient incident created by the function:
