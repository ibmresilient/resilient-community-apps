## Requirements
This app supports the IBM Security QRadar SOAR Platform and the IBM Security QRadar SOAR for IBM Cloud Pak for Security.

### SOAR platform
The SOAR platform supports two app deployment mechanisms, Edge Gateway (formerly App Host) and integration server.

If deploying to a SOAR platform with an Edge Gateway, the requirements are:
* SOAR platform >= `46.0.8131`.
* The app is in a container-based format (available from the AppExchange as a `zip` file).

If deploying to a SOAR platform with an integration server, the requirements are:
* SOAR platform >= `46.0.8131`.
* The app is in the older integration format (available from the AppExchange as a `zip` file which contains a `tar.gz` file).
* Integration server is running `resilient-circuits>=49.1.0`.
* If using an API key account, make sure the account provides the following minimum permissions: 
  | Name | Permissions |
  | ---- | ----------- |
  | Org Data | Read |
  | Function | Read |

The following SOAR platform guides provide additional information: 
* _Edge Gateway Deployment Guide_ or _App Host Deployment Guide_: provides installation, configuration, and troubleshooting information, including proxy server settings. 
* _Integration Server Guide_: provides installation, configuration, and troubleshooting information, including proxy server settings.
* _System Administrator Guide_: provides the procedure to install, configure and deploy apps. 

The above guides are available on the IBM Documentation website at [ibm.biz/soar-docs](https://ibm.biz/soar-docs). On this web page, select your SOAR platform version. On the follow-on page, you can find the _Edge Gateway Deployment Guide_, _App Host Deployment Guide_, or _Integration Server Guide_ by expanding **Apps** in the Table of Contents pane. The System Administrator Guide is available by expanding **System Administrator**.

### Cloud Pak for Security
If you are deploying to IBM Cloud Pak for Security, the requirements are:
* IBM Cloud Pak for Security >= `1.10`.
* Cloud Pak is configured with an Edge Gateway.
* The app is in a container-based format (available from the AppExchange as a `zip` file).

The following Cloud Pak guides provide additional information: 
* _Edge Gateway Deployment Guide_ or _App Host Deployment Guide_: provides installation, configuration, and troubleshooting information, including proxy server settings. From the Table of Contents, select Case Management and Orchestration & Automation > **Orchestration and Automation Apps**.
* _System Administrator Guide_: provides information to install, configure, and deploy apps. From the IBM Cloud Pak for Security IBM Documentation table of contents, select Case Management and Orchestration & Automation > **System administrator**.

These guides are available on the IBM Documentation website at [ibm.biz/cp4s-docs](https://ibm.biz/cp4s-docs). From this web page, select your IBM Cloud Pak for Security version. From the version-specific IBM Documentation page, select Case Management and Orchestration & Automation.

### Proxy Server
The app **does** support a proxy server.

### Python Environment
Python 3.6 and Python 3.9 are supported.
Additional package dependencies may exist for each of these packages:
* resilient-circuits>=49.1.0

### Development Version

This app has been implemented using:
| Product Name | API URL | API Version |
| ------------ | ------- | ----------- |
| Mandiant Threat Intelligence | `https://api.intelligence.mandiant.com` | v4 |

### Endpoint Configuration

This application supports Mandiant's APIV4. No endpoint configuration is required other than the API Key and Secret which can be found in the endpoint user-interface under settings.

---

## Installation

### Install
* To install or uninstall an App or Integration on the _SOAR platform_, see the documentation at [ibm.biz/soar-docs](https://ibm.biz/soar-docs).
* To install or uninstall an App on _IBM Cloud Pak for Security_, see the documentation at [ibm.biz/cp4s-docs](https://ibm.biz/cp4s-docs) and follow the instructions above to navigate to Orchestration and Automation.

### App Configuration
The following table provides the settings you need to configure the app. These settings are made in the app.config file. See the documentation discussed in the Requirements section for the procedure.

| Config | Required | Example | Description |
| ------ | :------: | ------- | ----------- |
| api_key | `Yes` | `7659xxxx29bc6cxxxx` | API key required for authentication |
| api_secret | `Yes` | `6546xxxx29bc6cxxxx` | API secret required for authentication |

    The purpose of this function is to flatten and organize data from the `gathered_info`
    dictionary and append it to the `compiled_section` list. The function can also handle
    recursive calls when it encounters nested dictionaries or lists.

    Here's a breakdown of its functionality:
        1. It iterates through the keys of the `gathered_info` dictionary.
        2. If a key corresponds to a dictionary, it recursively calls itself with the nested
            dictionary, aiming to flatten it, and appends the results to the `compiled_section`.
        3. If the `gathered_info` is not a list and the value associated with the current key
            is a dictionary, it also recursively calls itself to flatten the nested dictionary.
        4. If the current key is not a list, and the value is a list, it iterates through the
            list and checks if the elements are dictionaries or lists. If so, it recursively
            calls itself on each element and appends the results to the `compiled_section`.
        5. If neither of the above conditions is met (i.e., the key or value is not a list or
            dictionary), it formats the key and value into a subsection using a function called
            `compile_section_by_dtype`. It then appends this subsection to the `compiled_section`.
        6. Finally, it returns the `compiled_section` containing the flattened and organized data.

                                            flattening.
