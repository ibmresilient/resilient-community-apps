def compile_hits_section(gathered_info, compiled_section:list) -> list:
    """ 
    The purpose of this function is to flatten and organize data from the `gathered_info`
    dictionary and append it to the `compiled_section` list. The function can also handle
    recursive calls when it encounters nested dictionaries or lists.

    Here's a breakdown of its functionality:
        1. It iterates through the keys of the `gathered_info` dictionary.
        2. If a key corresponds to a dictionary, it recursively calls itself with the nested
            dictionary, aiming to flatten it, and appends the results to the `compiled_section`.
        3. If the `gathered_info` is not a list and the value associated with the current key
            is a dictionary, it also recursively calls itself to flatten the nested dictionary.
        4. If the current key is not a list, and the value is a list, it iterates through the
            list and checks if the elements are dictionaries or lists. If so, it recursively
            calls itself on each element and appends the results to the `compiled_section`.
        5. If neither of the above conditions is met (i.e., the key or value is not a list or
            dictionary), it formats the key and value into a subsection using a function called
            `compile_section_by_dtype`. It then appends this subsection to the `compiled_section`.
        6. Finally, it returns the `compiled_section` containing the flattened and organized data.

    ----

                                            flattening.
        compiled_section        (list) : Final flattened result. Contains a list of dictionaries.
