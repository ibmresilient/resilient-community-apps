# Resilient Integration with Have I Been Pwned
**This package contains two functions that allows you to search for breaches and pastes given an email address as an input.**


## app.config settings:
Set if using a proxy

    [fn_hibp]
    ## Proxy settings if needed
    #hibp_proxy_http=
    #hibp_proxy_https=
    hibp_api_key=< Have I Been Pwned API Key>

As of recent July 2019 changes, HIBP released v3 of the API (deprecating v2) and now requires a for-fee API Key (see https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/Key). 
If upgrading from version 1.0.0,  **manually** add the **hibp_api_key** setting to your app.config file.

Version 2.0.0 of Have I Been Pwned includes a modification to the returned payload. These changes include the incorporation of resilient-lib and results from the post processing script modified from *results.Breaches* to *results.content["Breaches"]*.

}
```


## Pre-Process Scripts:
This example sets the email_address value **to the value of the Incident's Artifact.**
```python
inputs.email_address = artifact.value
```

## Post-Process Script:
This example adds to the artifact's description the number of breaches the email address was a part of if any exist.
```python
if results.Breaches:
  try:
    des = artifact.description.content
  except Exception, e:
    des = None

  if des is None:
    artifact.description = "Breaches: " + str(len(results.Breaches))
  else:
    artifact.description = des + "\nBreaches: " + str(len(results.Breaches))
```

## Rules
| Rule Name | Object Type | Workflow Triggered | Conditions |
| --------- | :---------: | ------------------ | ---------- |
| Have I Been Pwned Search | `Artifact` | `Have I Been Pwned Search` | `Type` has one of `["Email Recipient", "Email Sender"]`
