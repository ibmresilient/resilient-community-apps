# Email calendar invite function   
### Craig Roberts, EMEA Sales Engineer, IBM Security

This function sends calendar invite to all the members and owner of an incident for incident management meetings etc.
 It directly connects to an SMTP server so ensure your network and mailbox allows this.

The description is flexible so could include webex details etc. 

This function doesn't return any response, it includes an example workflow.
