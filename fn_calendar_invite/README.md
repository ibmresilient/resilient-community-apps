Resilient Circuits Components for 'fn_calendar_invite'

### Key Features
<!--
  List the Key Features of the Integration
-->
fn_calendar_invite function takes the input incident id and retrieves the members and the owner of the incident and their email addresses.  The function creates an email and calendar ICS file and sends an email to all incident members using an SMTP server inviting them to a meeting to discuss the incident.
Included in the package is an example workflow that uses the fn_calendar_invite function and an example rule for creating the fn_calendar_invite workflow menu item. Both the example workflow and rule are each called “Example: Calendar Invite”.

## Requirements
<!--
  List any Requirements 
-->
This app supports the IBM Resilient SOAR Platform and the IBM Cloud Pak for Security.

### Resilient platform
The Resilient platform supports two app deployment mechanisms, App Host and integration server.

If deploying to a Resilient platform with an App Host, the requirements are:
* Resilient platform >= `36.0.5634`.
* The app is in a container-based format (available from the AppExchange as a `zip` file).

If deploying to a Resilient platform with an integration server, the requirements are:
* Resilient platform >= `36.0.5634`.
* The app is in the older integration format (available from the AppExchange as a `zip` file which contains a `tar.gz` file).
* Integration server is running `resilient_circuits>=30.0.0`.
* If using an API key account, make sure the account provides the following minimum permissions: 
  | Name | Permissions |
  | ---- | ----------- |
  | Org Data | Read |
  | Function | Read |
  | Incidents | Read |
  | Users | Read |

The following Resilient platform guides provide additional information: 
* _App Host Deployment Guide_: provides installation, configuration, and troubleshooting information, including proxy server settings. 
* _Integration Server Guide_: provides installation, configuration, and troubleshooting information, including proxy server settings.
* _System Administrator Guide_: provides the procedure to install, configure and deploy apps. 

The above guides are available on the IBM Knowledge Center at [ibm.biz/resilient-docs](https://ibm.biz/resilient-docs). On this web page, select your Resilient platform version. On the follow-on page, you can find the _App Host Deployment Guide_ or _Integration Server Guide_ by expanding **Resilient Apps** in the Table of Contents pane. The System Administrator Guide is available by expanding **System Administrator**.

### Cloud Pak for Security
If you are deploying to IBM Cloud Pak for Security, the requirements are:
* IBM Cloud Pak for Security >= 1.4.
* Cloud Pak is configured with an App Host.
* The app is in a container-based format (available from the AppExchange as a `zip` file).

The following Cloud Pak guides provide additional information: 
* _App Host Deployment Guide_: provides installation, configuration, and troubleshooting information, including proxy server settings. From the Table of Contents, select Case Management and Orchestration & Automation > **Orchestration and Automation Apps**.
* _System Administrator Guide_: provides information to install, configure, and deploy apps. From the IBM Cloud Pak for Security Knowledge Center table of contents, select Case Management and Orchestration & Automation > **System administrator**.

These guides are available on the IBM Knowledge Center at [ibm.biz/cp4s-docs](https://ibm.biz/cp4s-docs). From this web page, select your IBM Cloud Pak for Security version. From the version-specific Knowledge Center page, select Case Management and Orchestration & Automation.

### Proxy Server
The app supports a proxy server.
