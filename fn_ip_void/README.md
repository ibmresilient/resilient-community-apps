**A Resilient Function to integrate with the IP Void API**

 ![screenshot: main](./doc/screenshots/main.png)

Integrates with IP Void's vast range of IP Address tools to discover details about IP addresses helping you get enriched information about a Resilient Artifact

---

## Requirements
<!--
  List any Requirements 
-->
* Resilient platform >= `v37.2.38`
* An Integration Server running `resilient_circuits>=30.0.0`
  * To set up an Integration Server see: [ibm.biz/res-int-server-guide](https://ibm.biz/res-int-server-guide)
  * If using API Keys, minimum required permissions are:
      * Org Data: Read, Edit
      * Function: Read
---

## Installation
* Download the `fn_ip_void.zip`.
* Copy the `.zip` to your Integration Server and SSH into it.
* **Unzip** the package:
  ```
  $ unzip fn_ip_void-x.x.x.zip
  ```
* **Change Directory** into the unzipped directory:
  ```
  $ cd fn_ip_void-x.x.x
  ```
* **Install** the package:
  ```
  $ pip install fn_ip_void-x.x.x.tar.gz
  ```
* Import the **configurations** into your app.config file:
  ```
  $ resilient-circuits config -u -l fn-ip-void
  ```
* Import the fn_ip_void **customizations** into the Resilient platform:
  ```
  $ resilient-circuits customize -y -l fn-ip-void
  ```
* Open the config file, scroll to the bottom and edit your fn_ip_void configurations:
  ```
  $ nano ~/.resilient/app.config
  ```
  | Config | Required | Example | Description |
  | ------ | :------: | ------- | ----------- |
  | **ipvoid_base_url** | Yes | `https://endpoint.apivoid.com` | The main API endpoint |
  | **ipvoid_sub_url** | Yes | `v1/pay-as-you-go/` | If you have  a paid subscription or using a different version of the API, enter that here |
  | **ipvoid_api_key** | Yes | `<your-api-key>` | You IP Void API Key |

* **Save** and **Close** the app.config file.
* [Optional]: Run selftest to test the Integration you configured:
  ```
  $ resilient-circuits selftest -l fn-ip-void
  ```
* **Run** resilient-circuits or restart the Service on Windows/Linux:
  ```
  $ resilient-circuits run
  ```


---

## Uninstall
* SSH into your Integration Server.
* **Uninstall** the package:
  ```
  $ pip uninstall fn-ip-void
  ```
* Open the config file, scroll to the [fn_ip_void] section and remove the section or prefix `#` to comment out the section.
* **Save** and **Close** the app.config file.

---

## Troubleshooting
There are several ways to verify the successful operation of a function.

### Resilient Action Status
* When viewing an incident, use the Actions menu to view **Action Status**.
* By default, pending and errors are displayed.
* Modify the filter for actions to also show Completed actions.
* Clicking on an action displays additional information on the progress made or what error occurred.

### Resilient Scripting Log
* A separate log file is available to review scripting errors.
* This is useful when issues occur in the pre-processing or post-processing scripts.
* The default location for this log file is: `/var/log/resilient-scripting/resilient-scripting.log`.

### Resilient Logs
* By default, Resilient logs are retained at `/usr/share/co3/logs`.
* The `client.log` may contain additional information regarding the execution of functions.

### Resilient-Circuits
* The log is controlled in the `.resilient/app.config` file under the section [resilient] and the property `logdir`.
* The default file name is `app.log`.
* Each function will create progress information.
* Failures will show up as errors and may contain python trace statements.
