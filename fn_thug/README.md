# Thug

Thug is a client honeypot that emulates a real web browser, fetches and executes any internal or external JavaScript,
follows all redirects, downloadable files just like any browser would do, and collects the results.

This integration is a Function that can be called from a Resilient workflow to investigate a URL.
It loads a Thug docker image and submits the URL for testing.
The results are available to Resilient as a SVG image and JSON report.
