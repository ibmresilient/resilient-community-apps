## History
7/20 -  Initial Release

## About this Documentation:
Many customers will require the use of their own private container repository for App Host.
One key use includes the building and referencing to their own integrations. Another is to maintain
an air-gapped environment with IBM Resilient. This document provides guidance on how to setup a private respository.
This documentation covers how to setup your private registry for use with App Host.

## Private Registries
Many different solutions are available for both on-premise and cloud-based container repositories.
Below is a short list of some of these registries:

Cloud-Based Solutions
* IBM Cloud
* Quay.io
* Github
* Azure
* Google
* JFrog

Amazon AWS ECR doesn't appear to work App Host at this time.

On-premise Solutions
* Quay.io
* Docker
* Github
* JFrog
* Harbor

## Mirroring IBM Resilient Containers to Private Registries
Unfortunately, only one registry can be used at a time with App Host. In order to use
both the IBM AppExchange published Apps and your own custom integrations, it will be 
Refer to [README](README.pdf) file in this directory for information on
how to mirror IBM Resilient containers to a private container registry. Unfortunately, 
only one registry can be used with APP Host at a time, requiring this mirroring process.

## Configuring App Host for Private Registries
Once your containers are available in your private container registry,
follow these steps to reconfigure App Host to use this registry: 

* Login to your App Host
* Run the `configureAppHostRegistry` tool. You may need to run the command as root.
* Follow the prompts. The registry URL needs to be start with either `http://` or `https://`. 
* If your registry is public, no additional authentication is required. Private
registries require authentication user and password credentials. Some registries
use API tokens and access policies for registry access. Enable `read` permissions for
registry access. 

### IBM Cloud Container Registry (CR) Setup
To illustrate the setup of a private registry, the following steps were used to 
configure IBM Cloud Registry for App Host. Each step could be performed using either the `ibmcloud cr` CLI tool
or the web-based console. Documentation on all these steps is found [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry).
* Configure a namespace for your container images. App Host requires `ibmresilient`.
* Create a service-id associated with your registry
* Add policies to your service-id for `Reader` permissions
* Create an API key. The API key will always be named 'iamapikey' but will use the API key secret as its password. 

The following example shows the App Host configuration steps when using IBM Cloud Container Registry. 
```
$ sudo configureAppHostRegistry 
[sudo] password for appadmin:

## Building Apps for Private Registries
In order to build apps for a private registry, your development environment will need the following tools:
* IBM Resilient `resilient-sdk` for App development.
* Docker or Podman for container creation
* Optionally the CLI tool provided by your registry provider (ex. `ibmcloud` for IBM Cloud Container Registry).

### App Development
Refer to the App development guides provided [here]( https://www-03preprod.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSBRUQ_37.0.0/doc/apps/Introduction.html). There are two steps needed once your App is complete:
* Running `resilient-sdk package` to build the .zip file used to import your App into Resilient. 
Information on these procedures are found in the Resilient App Host development guides.

  `Ex. resilient-sdk package -p .`
* Running `docker build` or `podman build` to tag and push your App container to your private registry.

#### Private Registry Access
When using the CLI tool provided by your registry provider, first sign in to the registry. Refer to your registry 
provider's documentation on how to install the CLI tools.

IBM Cloud Container Registry has the following syntax:
```
ibmcloud login -a https://cloud.ibm.com -u passcode -p xxxx
ibmcloud cr login
```

Other registries require the developer to edit and use the docker or podman tool for authentication such as: 
```
docker login -u iamapikey -p <apikey> us.icr.io
```

Other login mechanism's requires one to edit the tool's configuration file located on the developer's file system such as:
`~/.docker/config.json`.

Once authenticated, container's can built and pushed to the private registry as following 
(substitute podman for docker as appropriate):

```
docker build . -t us.icr.io/ibmresilient/fn_integration:1.0.0
docker push us.icr.io/ibmresilient/fn_integration:1.0.0
```

Existing local containers can also be retagged and pushed to your private registry:

```
$ docker images
REPOSITORY                     TAG        IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
ibmresilient/fn_integration    1.0.0      59ccf4795c0b        3 weeks ago         818MB

$ docker tag 59ccf4795c0b us.icr.io/ibmresilient/fn_integration:1.0.0
$ docker push us.icr.io/ibmresilient/fn_integration:1.0.0
```
