**Amazon AWS IAM Integration for Resilient**

 ![screenshot: main](./doc/screenshots/main.png)

Integration with Amazon AWS IAM to facilitate manual enrichment and targeted remediation actions. Teams can investigate an attack by searching for AWS user accounts across an AWS environment, and quickly respond to attacks by executing remediation actions, such as removing accounts or removing permissions or login profiles for suspicious accounts from within the Resilient platform

---

## Requirements
<!--
  List any Requirements 
-->
* Resilient platform >= `v33.0.5112`
* An Integration Server running `resilient_circuits>=30.0.0`
  * To set up an Integration Server see: [ibm.biz/res-int-server-guide](https://ibm.biz/res-int-server-guide)

---

## Installation
* Download the `fn_aws_iam.zip`.
* Copy the `.zip` to your Integration Server and SSH into it.
* **Unzip** the package:
  ```
  $ unzip fn_aws_iam-x.x.x.zip
  ```
* **Change Directory** into the unzipped directory:
  ```
  $ cd fn_aws_iam-x.x.x
  ```
* **Install** the package:
  ```
  $ pip install fn_aws_iam-x.x.x.tar.gz
  ```
* Import the **configurations** into your app.config file:
  ```
  $ resilient-circuits config -u
  ```
* Import the fn_aws_iam **customizations** into the Resilient platform:
  ```
  $ resilient-circuits customize -y -l fn-aws-iam
  ```
* Open the config file, scroll to the bottom and edit your fn_aws_iam configurations:
  ```
  $ nano ~/.resilient/app.config
  ```
  | Config | Required | Example | Description |
  | ------ | :------: | ------- | ----------- |
  | **aws_iam_access_key_id** | Yes | `ABCD1EFGHI2JK3L4MNOP` | *AWS access key id of user with programmatic (API) access to AWS IAM services for an AWS account. Note: User must have sufficent permissions to be able to manage IAM resources for the AWS account.* |
  | **aws_iam_secret_access_key** | Yes | `aBcdeFGH/iJkl1MNo2P3Q4rs5tuV6wXYZAbc+Def` | *AWS secret access key used for programmatic (API) access to AWS services.* |
  | **aws_iam_region** | No | `us-west-1` | *Optional setting for an IAM AWS region if required.* |
  | **http_proxy** | No | `http://proxy:80` | *Optional setting for an http proxy if required.* |
  | **https_proxy** | No | `http://proxy:80` | *Optional setting for an http proxy if required.* |
  
* **Save** and **Close** the app.config file.
* [Optional]: Run selftest to test the Integration you configured:
  ```
  $ resilient-circuits selftest -l fn-aws-iam
  ```
* **Run** resilient-circuits or restart the Service on Windows/Linux:
  ```
  $ resilient-circuits run
  ```

### Custom Layouts
<!--
  Use this section to provide guidance on where the user should add any custom fields and data tables.
  You may wish to recommend a new incident tab.
  You should save a screenshot "custom_layouts.png" in the doc/screenshots directory and reference it here
-->
* Import the Data Tables and Custom Fields like the screenshot below:

  ![screenshot: custom_layouts](./doc/screenshots/custom_layouts.png)

---

## Uninstall
* SSH into your Integration Server.
* **Uninstall** the package:
  ```
  $ pip uninstall fn-aws-iam
  ```
* Open the config file, scroll to the [fn_aws_iam] section and remove the section or prefix `#` to comment out the section.
* **Save** and **Close** the app.config file.

---

## Troubleshooting
There are several ways to verify the successful operation of a function.

### Resilient Action Status
* When viewing an incident, use the Actions menu to view **Action Status**.
* By default, pending and errors are displayed.
* Modify the filter for actions to also show Completed actions.
* Clicking on an action displays additional information on the progress made or what error occurred.

### Resilient Scripting Log
* A separate log file is available to review scripting errors.
* This is useful when issues occur in the pre-processing or post-processing scripts.
* The default location for this log file is: `/var/log/resilient-scripting/resilient-scripting.log`.

### Resilient Logs
* By default, Resilient logs are retained at `/usr/share/co3/logs`.
* The `client.log` may contain additional information regarding the execution of functions.

### Resilient-Circuits
* The log is controlled in the `.resilient/app.config` file under the section [resilient] and the property `logdir`.
* The default file name is `app.log`.
* Each function will create progress information.
* Failures will show up as errors and may contain python trace statements.
