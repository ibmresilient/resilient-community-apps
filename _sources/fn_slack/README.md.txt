## Release Notes
<!--
  Specify all changes in this release. Do not remove the release
  notes of a previous release
-->
| Version | Notes |
| ------- | ----- |
| 2.1.0 |  Add Playbooks
| 2.0.0 | Migrated slackclient to v2, Added lookup via channel ID to improve speed |
| 1.0.2 | Support for App Host, proxy support added |

---
### fn_slack 2.1.0 Changes
In v2.1, the existing rules and workflows have been replaced with playbooks.
This change is made to support the ongoing, newer capabilities of playbooks.
Each playbook has the same functionality as the previous, corresponding rule/workflow.

If upgrading from a previous release, you'll noticed that the previous release's rules/workflows remain in place. Both sets of rules and playbooks are active. For manual actions, playbooks will have the same name as it's corresponding rule, but with "(PB)" added at the end.
For automatic actions, the playbooks will be disabled by default.

You can continue to use the rules/workflows.
But migrating to playbooks will provide greater functionality along with future app enhancements and bug fixes.

---
### fn_slack 2.0.0 Considerations

Slack integration is now able to use the channel ID instead of the channel name to post and archive. When using the channel name, this function must first retrieve a list of all channels in a workspace and then iterate through the list to find the desired channel. Using the channel ID, the function is able to immediately retrieve the desired channel and therefore is reccommended to use over channel name when calling functions via SOAR.

---

## Overview
<!--
  Provide a high-level description of the function itself and its remote software or application.
  The text below is parsed from the "description" and "long_description" attributes in the setup.py file
-->
**SOAR App for 'fn_slack'**



Function creates a Slack message based on a SOAR Incident, it's Tasks, Notes, Artifacts and Attachments, exports conversation history from Slack channel to a text file, saves the text file as an Attachment and archives the Slack channel.

### Key Features
<!--
  List the Key Features of the Integration
-->
* Creating private or public channels
* Inviting users to conversations
* Preserving embedded links
* Posting messages from Incidents, Notes, Artifacts and Tasks displaying authorship
* Uploading Incident, Task or Artifact attachment
* Exporting conversation history to a text file, saving it as an Attachment in SOAR and archiving Slack channel

---

## Requirements
<!--
  List any Requirements
-->
* slackclient~=2.9.4

This app supports the IBM Security QRadar SOAR Platform and the IBM Security QRadar SOAR for IBM Cloud Pak for Security.

### SOAR platform
The SOAR platform supports two app deployment mechanisms, App Host and integration server.

If deploying to a SOAR platform with an App Host, the requirements are:
* SOAR platform >= `43.1.49`.
* The app is in a container-based format (available from the AppExchange as a `zip` file).

If deploying to a SOAR platform with an integration server, the requirements are:
* SOAR platform >= `43.1.49`.
* The app is in the older integration format (available from the AppExchange as a `zip` file which contains a `tar.gz` file).
* Integration server is running `resilient_circuits>=45.0.0`.
* If using an API key account, make sure the account provides the following minimum permissions:
  | Name | Permissions |
  | ---- | ----------- |
  | Org Data | Read |
  | Function | Read |

The following SOAR platform guides provide additional information:
* _App Host Deployment Guide_: provides installation, configuration, and troubleshooting information, including proxy server settings.
* _Integration Server Guide_: provides installation, configuration, and troubleshooting information, including proxy server settings.
* _System Administrator Guide_: provides the procedure to install, configure and deploy apps.

The above guides are available on the IBM Documentation website at [ibm.biz/soar-docs](https://ibm.biz/soar-docs). On this web page, select your SOAR platform version. On the follow-on page, you can find the _App Host Deployment Guide_ or _Integration Server Guide_ by expanding **Apps** in the Table of Contents pane. The System Administrator Guide is available by expanding **System Administrator**.

### Cloud Pak for Security
If you are deploying to IBM Cloud Pak for Security, the requirements are:
* IBM Cloud Pak for Security >= 1.7
* Cloud Pak is configured with an App Host.
* The app is in a container-based format (available from the AppExchange as a `zip` file).

The following Cloud Pak guides provide additional information:
* _App Host Deployment Guide_: provides installation, configuration, and troubleshooting information, including proxy server settings. From the Table of Contents, select Case Management and Orchestration & Automation > **Orchestration and Automation Apps**.
* _System Administrator Guide_: provides information to install, configure, and deploy apps. From the IBM Cloud Pak for Security IBM Documentation table of contents, select Case Management and Orchestration & Automation > **System administrator**.

These guides are available on the IBM Documentation website at [ibm.biz/cp4s-docs](https://ibm.biz/cp4s-docs). From this web page, select your IBM Cloud Pak for Security version. From the version-specific IBM Documentation page, select Case Management and Orchestration & Automation.

### Proxy Server
The app does support a proxy server.

### Python Environment
Both Python 3.6 and Python 3.9 are supported.
Additional package dependencies may exist for each of these packages:
* resilient_circuits>=45.0.0
* slackclient~=2.9.4

### Endpoint Developed With

This app has been implemented using:
| Product Name | Product Version | API URL | API Version |
| ------------ | --------------- | ------- | ----------- |
| Slack | -- | https://api.slack.com/ | -- |

#### Prerequisites
<!--
List any prerequisites that are needed to use with this endpoint solution. Remove any section that is unnecessary.
-->
* Slack app OAuth Access Token

---

## Installation

### Install
* To install or uninstall an App or Integration on the _SOAR platform_, see the documentation at [ibm.biz/soar-docs](https://ibm.biz/soar-docs).
* To install or uninstall an App on _IBM Cloud Pak for Security_, see the documentation at [ibm.biz/cp4s-docs](https://ibm.biz/cp4s-docs) and follow the instructions above to navigate to Orchestration and Automation.

### App Configuration
The following table provides the settings you need to configure the app. These settings are made in the app.config file. See the documentation discussed in the Requirements section for the procedure.

| Config | Required | Example | Description |
| ------ | :------: | ------- | ----------- |
| **api_token** | Yes | `xoxb-xxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxx` | Slack app OAuth Access Token |
| **username** | Yes | `IBM SOAR` | Username represents the default submission author. Using a bot token instead of a person token will overwrite the username, using the bot name instead when posting |

The remainder of this section details the Slack configuration file changes.


It's possible to override the template used for archiving a channel.
Use the app.config setting: `template_file=/var/rescircuits/slack_template.jinja2` to reference the template file named `slack_template.jinja2` at location
`/var/rescircuits`. See the default template referenced [in the Template file section](#template_file).
