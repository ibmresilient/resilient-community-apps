## Requirements
<!--
  List any Requirements
-->
This app supports the IBM Security QRadar SOAR Platform and the IBM Security QRadar SOAR for IBM Cloud Pak for Security.

### SOAR platform
The SOAR platform supports two app deployment mechanisms, Edge Gateway (also known as App Host) and integration server.

If deploying to a SOAR platform with an App Host, the requirements are:
* SOAR platform >= `40.0.6554`.
* The app is in a container-based format (available from the AppExchange as a `zip` file).

If deploying to a SOAR platform with an integration server, the requirements are:
* SOAR platform >= `40.0.6554`.
* The app is in the older integration format (available from the AppExchange as a `zip` file which contains a `tar.gz` file).
* Integration server is running `resilient_circuits>=40.0.0`.
* If using an API key account, make sure the account provides the following minimum permissions:
  | Name | Permissions |
  | ---- | ----------- |
  | Org Data | Read |
  | Function | Read |


The following SOAR platform guides provide additional information:
* _Edge Gateway Deployment Guide_ or _App Host Deployment Guide_: provides installation, configuration, and troubleshooting information, including proxy server settings.
* _Integration Server Guide_: provides installation, configuration, and troubleshooting information, including proxy server settings.
* _System Administrator Guide_: provides the procedure to install, configure and deploy apps.

The above guides are available on the IBM Documentation website at [ibm.biz/soar-docs](https://ibm.biz/soar-docs). On this web page, select your SOAR platform version. On the follow-on page, you can find the _Edge Gateway Deployment Guide_, _App Host Deployment Guide_, or _Integration Server Guide_ by expanding **Apps** in the Table of Contents pane. The System Administrator Guide is available by expanding **System Administrator**.

### Cloud Pak for Security
If you are deploying to IBM Cloud Pak for Security, the requirements are:
* IBM Cloud Pak for Security >= `1.10.15`.
* Cloud Pak is configured with an Edge Gateway.
* The app is in a container-based format (available from the AppExchange as a `zip` file).

The following Cloud Pak guides provide additional information:
* _Edge Gateway Deployment Guide_ or _App Host Deployment Guide_: provides installation, configuration, and troubleshooting information, including proxy server settings. From the Table of Contents, select Case Management and Orchestration & Automation > **Orchestration and Automation Apps**.
* _System Administrator Guide_: provides information to install, configure, and deploy apps. From the IBM Cloud Pak for Security IBM Documentation table of contents, select Case Management and Orchestration & Automation > **System administrator**.

These guides are available on the IBM Documentation website at [ibm.biz/cp4s-docs](https://ibm.biz/cp4s-docs). From this web page, select your IBM Cloud Pak for Security version. From the version-specific IBM Documentation page, select Case Management and Orchestration & Automation.

### Proxy Server
The app **does**  support a proxy server.

### Python Environment
Python 3.9, 3.11, and 3.12 are officially supported. When deployed as an app, the app runs on Python 3.11.
Additional package dependencies may exist for each of these packages:
* python-dateutil>=2.8.0
* requests>=2.21.0
* resilient-lib>=40.0
* resilient_circuits>=40.0.0


## Installation

### Install
* To install or uninstall an App or Integration on the _SOAR platform_, see the documentation at [ibm.biz/soar-docs](https://ibm.biz/soar-docs).
* To install or uninstall an App on _IBM Cloud Pak for Security_, see the documentation at [ibm.biz/cp4s-docs](https://ibm.biz/cp4s-docs) and follow the instructions above to navigate to Orchestration and Automation.

### App Configuration
The following table provides the settings you need to configure the app. These settings are made in the app.config file. See the documentation discussed in the Requirements section for the procedure.

| Config | Required | Example | Description |
| ------ | :------: | ------- | ----------- |
| **phish_tank_api_key** | Yes | `` |   |
| **phish_tank_api_url** | Yes | `https://checkurl.phishtank.com/checkurl/` |  |
| **proxy** | Yes | `` | 

### Integration Server
* Download the `fn_phish_tank.zip`
* Copy the `.zip` to your Integration Server and SSH into it.
* **Unzip** the package:
  ```
  $ unzip fn_phish_tank-x.x.x.zip
  ```
* **Change Directory** into the unzipped Directory:
  ```
  $ cd fn_phish_tank-x.x.x
  ```
* **Install** the package:
  ```
  $ pip install fn_phish_tank-x.x.x.tar.gz
  ```
* Import the **configurations** into your app.config file:
  ```
  $ resilient-circuits config -u
  ```
* Import the fn_phish_tank **customizations** into the Resilient platform:
  ```
  $ resilient-circuits customize -y -l fn-phish-tank
  ```
* Open the config file, scroll to the bottom and edit your fn_phish_tank configurations:
  ```
  $ nano ~/.resilient/app.config
  ```
  | Config | Required | Example | Description |
  | ------ | :------: | ------- | ----------- |
  | **phish_tank_api_url** | Yes | `https://checkurl.phishtank.com/checkurl/` | PhishTank API Access URL |
  | **phish_tank_api_key** | Yes | - | PhishTank API Key |
  | **proxy** | No | `127.0.0.1` | Proxy Server Address. Default is `None` |

* **Save** and **Close** the app.config file.
* [Optional]: Run selftest to test the Integration you configured:
  ```
  $ resilient-circuits selftest -l fn-phish-tank
  ```
* **Run** resilient-circuits or restart the Service on Windows/Linux:
  ```
  $ resilient-circuits run
  ```
---
## Uninstall
* SSH into your Integration Server
* **Uninstall** the package:
  ```
  $ pip uninstall fn-phish-tank
  ```
* Open the config file, scroll to the [fn_phish_tank] section and remove the section or prefix `#` to comment out the section.
* **Save** and **Close** the app.config file.

## Function - Phish Tank Submit URL
Searches the PhishTank database (https://www.phishtank.com/) to determine if a URL is a phishing URL or not. The information returned from PhishTank is used to update the Artifacts description and add a note to the incident.
