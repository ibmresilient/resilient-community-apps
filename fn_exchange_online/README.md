## Release Notes
<!--
  Specify all changes in this release. Do not remove the release 
  notes of a previous release
-->
### v1.1.0
The 1.1.0 release addresses performance issues when querying messages of all Exchange Online users of a tenant.
* Added batching of multiple message query requests into a single Microsoft Graph API request call using the /$batch endpoint.  The maximum number of requests that Microsoft Graph currently supports in the batch endpoint is 20 requests.  Should Microsoft change this value, the <code>max_batch_requests</code>  parameter should be updated in the app.config file.

* Added "max retries" capability to Microsoft Graph API requests. When making many Microsoft Graph API calls, the Microsoft Graph server may throttle the client and return  503 (server unavailable)  or 429 (too many requests) status codes. When this happens, the server may send back a "Retry-After" response header indicating to the client how long to wait and retry sending the request. If this header is not sent to the client, parameters can be set to indicate how long to wait and retry sending the request again.   These parameters are settable in the app.config file:
  * max_retries_total
  * max_retries_backoff_factor

* Added capability to specify a subset of email addresses to search. When querying messages of <code>all</code> tenant email addresses, the user can specify a subset of all user mailboxes to search.  For example, enter <code>all:r</code> in the <code>Email Address</code> select field of the <code>Example: Exchange Online Query Messages</code> activity popup menu  to specify searching all users with PrincipalUserName starting with the letter "r".  Enter <code>all:mc</code> to search all users starting with "mc".  

* The <code>Example: Exchange Online Query Messages</code> and <code>Example: Exchange Online Delete Messages from Query Results</code> menu item rules and workflows allow the user to multi-select where query results are displayed: 
  * Exchange Online data table
  * Incident note
  * Incident attachment 

* Fixed bug in query messages function which resulted in the search not completing when the queried message subject or message body contained single quote, hashtag or ampersand characters.

* Removed Exchange Online Web Link to Outlook message from the Exchange Online Message Query Results data table when the message is deleted or not found.

**NOTE** Existing users running Exchange Online functions on an integration server, should save the [fn_exchange_online] section of their app.config file to another file and delete that section from the app.config file before installing the new version, as this section has changed.  After installation, run the following command to obtain the new configuration:
```
  $ resilient-circuits config -u -l fn-microsoft-exchange-online
  ```
Edit the required configuration setting as described in the [Integration Server](#integration-server) section.


### v1.0.0
* Initial Release

## Overview
<!--
  Provide a high-level description of the function itself and its remote software or application.
  The text below is parsed from the "description" and "long_description" attributes in the setup.py file
-->
Microsoft Exchange Online Functions for IBM Resilient provides the capability to access and manipulate Microsoft Exchange Online messages from the IBM Resilient SOAR Platform.  The integration uses Microsoft Graph API to access the data in Microsoft 365.  Included in the integration are the following capabilities:

* Get the user profile of the specified email address in JSON format.

* Get a specified message and return the results in JSON format.

* Get a specified message in .eml format and write as an incident attachment.

* Move a message to a specified "Well-known" Outlook folder.

* Send a message from the specified email address to the specified recipients with specified message subject and body text.

* Query messages of a single user, a list of users, or the whole tenant and return a list of messages matching the criteria: 
  * message sender
  * messages from a specific Well-known folder
  * message received date
  * text contained in the message subject or the message body
  * whether the message has attachments. 
  
  Detailed results are returned in the Exchange Online Query Message Results data table. Total messages found in each mailbox and the total query time are written to an incident note or attachment.

* Delete a single specified message from a specified email address.

* Delete a list of messages that are the results of a message query.  The messages deleted are written to the Exchange Online Query Messages data table.

* Create a meeting event in the organizer's Outlook calendar and send a calendar event message to meeting participants inviting them to the meeting.

The integration contains the following functions:

  Use this section to provide guidance on where the user should add any custom fields and data tables.
  You may wish to recommend a new incident tab.
  You should save a screenshot "custom_layouts.png" in the doc/screenshots directory and reference it here
-->
Create an Exchange Online custom incident tab and drag the Exchange Online Message Query Results data table on to the layout as shown in the following screenshot. When done, click Save.

## Microsoft Azure App Configuration

To run the Resilient Exchange Online integration, you must first register the application on Microsoft Azure portal.  The tenant ID, client ID and the client secret that are defined in the fn_exchange_online section of the app.config are assigned by Azure when the application is registered.  

### App Registration
To register the Resilient integration, click "App registrations" in Manage section of your Azure Active Directory domain account.  Then click the "New Registration" button as depicted in the image below.

![screenshot: custom_layouts](./doc/screenshots/MS-Azure-Register-New-App.png)

Enter a name for the integration. In this example, the name is "resilient-integration". Then press the "Register" button.

![screenshot: custom_layouts](./doc/screenshots/MS-Azure-Register-an-application.png)

Click on the newly created application. A page appears that is similar to the screenshot below.
Get the tenant and client IDs for the application, which are parameters in the app.config file:

![screenshot: custom_layouts](./doc/screenshots/MS-Azure-App-registrations.png)

Next, click on the left menu item, "Certificates & secrets" and create a secret, which is another application credential in the app.config.

![screenshot: custom_layouts](./doc/screenshots/MS-Azure-App-secrets.png)

### API Permissions
For the Resilient integration app to access data in Microsoft Graph, an administrator 
must grant it the correct permissions via a consent process. Click on "API permissions" on the left menu and then "+ Add a Permission".

![screenshot: custom_layouts](./doc/screenshots/MS-Azure-API-permissions.png)

Click on Microsoft Graph:

![screenshot: custom_layouts](./doc/screenshots/MS-Azure-MS-Graph.png)

Select Application permissions (not Delegated permissions):
![screenshot: custom_layouts](./doc/screenshots/MS-Azure-API-Application-permissions.png)

Check each of the following Microsoft Graph API "Application permissions":
* Calendar.ReadWrite
* Mail.ReadWrite
* Mail.Send
* MailboxSetting.Read
* User.Read.All

![screenshot: custom_layouts](./doc/screenshots/MS-Azure-API-permissions-checkboxes.png)

Once the API Application permissions are added, click the "Grant admin consent" button
for your domain:

## Troubleshooting
There are several ways to verify the successful operation of a function.

### Resilient Action Status
* When viewing an incident, use the Actions menu to view **Action Status**.
* By default, pending and errors are displayed.
* Modify the filter for actions to also show Completed actions.
* Clicking on an action displays additional information on the progress made or what error occurred.

### Resilient Scripting Log
* A separate log file is available to review scripting errors.
* This is useful when issues occur in the pre-processing or post-processing scripts.
* The default location for this log file is: `/var/log/resilient-scripting/resilient-scripting.log`.

### Resilient Logs
* By default, Resilient logs are retained at `/usr/share/co3/logs`.
* The `client.log` may contain additional information regarding the execution of functions.

### Resilient-Circuits
* The log is controlled in the `.resilient/app.config` file under the section [resilient] and the property `logdir`.
* The default file name is `app.log`.
* Each function will create progress information.
* Failures will show up as errors and may contain python trace statements.
