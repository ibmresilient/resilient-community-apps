# Title:         mirror-images.sh
# Description:   Facilitates the transfer of a number of named images from a source registry to a destination one

# Version:       1.0.0
set -x

#Â v1: At a high level; with this script we want to:
# 0. Determine whether to use docker or podman
# 1. Take in a named list of image we want to move WITH versions
# 2. Pull each image from the source registry only grabbing the tags specified
# 3. Tag each image with its new destination tag before push
# 4. Push each image with its new tag to the destination registry
# 5. Delete all the images we pulled except for those named in the preserved_images.conf file, note only images not in use will be deleted.

# Functions
# Function used to check the existance of a command
