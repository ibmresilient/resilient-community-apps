Description: Resilient functions simplify development of integrations by wrapping each external activity
            into an individual workflow component. These components can be easily installed, then used and combined in Resilient
            workflows. The Resilient platform sends data to the function component that performs an activity then returns the results
            to the workflow. The results can be acted upon by scripts, rules, and workflow decision points to dynamically orchestrate
            the security incident response activities.
