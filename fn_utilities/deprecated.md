# Utility Functions for SOAR is now deprecated

This app is no longer available for download and will soon be delisted from this AppExchange.
It has been split up into separate, smaller, yet equivalent, apps. These smaller apps are easier to maintain and should be easier for customers to consume in their playbooks. Consider using these other apps based on the functionality needed:

* [Network Utilities](https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/hub/extension/a4a42beebf6344cb9cdbe43d4461abe1)
* [SOAR Utilities](https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/hub/extension/2130e450a06aa760b2556bf981068159)
* [Parse Utilities](https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/hub/extension/a51cbe74d89fb399c28d23c8b47777b4)
* [Timer](https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/hub/extension/2ece7aed703426e5c67cdec55d94385f)
* [REST API](https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/hub/extension/b1e4814282b33a826f36c72cf1bc4751)

## Migration from Utility Functions for SOAR
In most cases, the use of a new function to replace Utility Functions for SOAR will be as simple has dropping it into your existing workflow or playbook
and copying the previous function' pre and post-processing scripts. In some cases, such a REST API, changes have been made to expand on the previous
function's functionality. The documentation for the new app should be consulted in all cases to ensure proper use.
