# Older integration applications

The functionality of `rc-query-runner` has been superseded by the capabilities
of workflow Functions.  The query-runner integrations in this folder are retained
for compatibility only.  New deployments should use the Function-based alternatives.

* rc-qradar-search: replace with fn_qradar_integration "QRadar Search" function
* rc-query-rest: replace with fn_utilities "Call REST API" function
* rc-shell-runner: replace with fn_utilities "Shell Command" function
* rc-splunk-search: replace with fn_splunk_integration "Splunk Search" function
