# 'command': defines the default commandline used for actions.
# Here the default action is to run a script, where the name of the script is {{action_name}}
# (the name of the Resilient custom action, lowercase, with non-characters replaced by underscores).
# This passes the artifact value as a command-line parameter (assuming that the action
# was on an artifact).

# NOTE: for PowerShell scripts on Windows, replace the default command with something like the below.
# You may need to add this option -ExecutionPolicy ByPass
${commentifbash}command=powershell "${scriptdir}\\{{action_name}}.ps1" "{{artifact.value|ps}}"

# 'result_disposition': defines how the result (stdout of the shell script) is handled.
# Here the default disposition is to attach the output to the incident as a new text file,
# where the filename is derived from the action name and the action timestamp

# You can specify a command, and a disposition, for specific actions
# (based on the action name).  For example below, a custom action 'nslookup' just
# runs the nslookup command directly, passing the artifact value as a parameter.
