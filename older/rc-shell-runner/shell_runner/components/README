# Components

Python files in this directory will be automatically loaded.
The loader looks for classes that implement <BaseComponent>
or some derived Circuits <Component> class, and attaches 
them to the application.

Supporting Python classes that are not Circuits components
should generally be placed in the `lib` directory.
