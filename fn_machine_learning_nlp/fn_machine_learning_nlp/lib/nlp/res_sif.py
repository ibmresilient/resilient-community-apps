    ------
    SIF: Smooth Inverse Frequency
    This is a module to build the SIF counts. Inverse means that the higher the frequency (of a word)
    in the sample dataset, the lower the importance in computing similarity.

    So this module takes a sample data and compute count for each work. The count can then be used to
    compute the frequency.
