## Overview
<!-- This description is taken from the in the "description" attribute setup.py file -->
**Resilient Circuits Components for 'fn_task_utils**

 ![screenshot: main](./doc/screenshots/main.png)

<!-- This description is taken from the in the "long_description" attribute setup.py file -->
Resilient Circuits Components which can be used to manipulate existing tasks or create new ones. Provides functions which can be invoked through standalone example rules or can be integrated as part of a custom workflow

---
## Key Features
<!-- List the Key Features of the Integration -->
* Create or Update tasks as a part of workflow.
* Add Notes to tasks from an integration to provide updates as actions are performed
* Ability to close either System or Custom tasks

---
## Requirements
<!-- List any Requirements -->
* IBM Resilient >= `v31.0.4235`
* An Integrations Server running `resilient-circuits >= v31.0.0`
  * To setup an Integrations Server see: [ibm.biz/res-int-server-guide](ibm.biz/res-int-server-guide)

---
## Installation
* Download the `fn_task_utils.zip`
* Copy the `.zip` to your Integrations Server and SSH into it.
* **Unzip** the package:
  ```
  $ unzip fn_task_utils-x.x.x.zip
  ```
* **Install** the package:
  ```
  $ pip install fn_task_utils-x.x.x.tar.gz
  ```
* Import the **configurations** into your app.config file:
  ```
  $ resilient-circuits config -u
  ```
* Import the fn_task_utils **customizations** into the Resilient Appliance:
  ```
  $ resilient-circuits customize -y -l fn-task-utils
  ```
* Open the config file, scroll to the bottom and edit your fn_task_utils **configurations**:
  ```
  $ nano ~/.resilient/app.config
  ```
  | Config | Required | Example | Description |
  | ------ | :------: | ------- | ----------- |

* **Save** and **Close** the app.config file.
* [Optional]: Run **selftest** to test you the Integration is configured:
  ```
  $ resilient-circuits selftest -l fn-task-utils
  ```
* **Run** resilient-circuits or restart the Service on Windows/Linux:
  ```
  $ resilient-circuits run
  ```

---
## Uninstall
* SSH into your Integrations Server
* **Uninstall** the package:
  ```
  $ pip uninstall fn-task-utils
  ```
* Open the config file, scroll to the [fn_task_utils] section and remove the section or prefix `#` to comment out the section.
* **Save** and **Close** the app.config file.

---
## Troubleshooting
There are several ways to verify the successful operation of a function. 

### Resilient Action Status
* When viewing an incident, use the Actions menu to view **Action Status**. 
* By default, pending and errors are displayed. 
* Modify the filter for actions to also show Completed actions.
* Clicking on an action displays additional information on the progress made or what error occurred.

### Resilient Scripting Log
* A separate log file is available to review scripting errors.
* This is useful when issues occur in the pre-processing or post-processing scripts.
* The default location for this log file is: `/var/log/resilient-scripting/resilient-scripting.log`.

### Resilient Logs
* By default, Resilient logs are retained at `/usr/share/co3/logs`.
* The `client.log` may contain additional information regarding the execution of functions.

### Resilient-Circuits
* The log is controlled in the `.resilient/app.config` file under the section [resilient] and the property `logdir`.
* The default file name is `app.log`.
* Each function will create progress information.
* Failures will show up as errors and may contain python trace statements.
