Here are some sandbox services that offer this intelligence:\n<ul>\n<li>Anubis - http://anubis.iseclab.org/ </li>\n<li>Malwr - https://malwr.com/ </li>\n<li>Threat Expert - http://www.threatexpert.com/submit.aspx </li>\n</ul>\n\nWhen identifying malware, record the following characteristics if possible:\n<ul>\n<li>Malware category (for example, virus, worm, or Trojan horse)</li>\n<li>Services, ports, protocols, and similar items that are attacked</li>\n<li>Vulnerabilities that are exploited, such as software flaws, misconfigurations, and social engineering.</li>\n<li>Malicious file names, sizes, content, and other metadata (such as email subjects and web URLs).</li>\n<li>Which versions of operating systems, devices, applications, and so on, may be affected.</li>\n<li>How the malware affects the infected host, including the names and locations of affected files, altered configuration settings, installed backdoor ports, and so on.</li>\n<li>How the malware propagates and how to approach containment.</li>\n<li>How to remove the malware from the host.</li>\n</ul>\n\nOne goal is to identify suspicious network activity or connections. To look at local connections on Windows 2000 and greater, you can use the netstat -on command. This will list all connections along with the associated process ID. From this listing, identify suspicious connections and record their process ID. Next, run a trusted version of taskmgr. If the process ID's are being displayed, go to View&gt;Selected Columns and select PID. Map the PID in question to the process or services. By right-clicking on a process entry, you can get its properties including the full path to the executable file on disk as well as its signature and signing chain.<br /><br />\n\nAnother useful exercise is to execute whois lookups on suspect IP addresses to get a sense of their credibility and purpose. This can be done at whois.net.<br /><br />\n\nCollect suspicious IP addresses, emails, documents and executables and attach them to the incident as artifacts. The system will correlate these against several threat intelligence sources and provide feedback. <br /><br />\n\nOther options:<br />\nRun Microsoft's Safety Scanner, http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx<br />\nSee tools provided at http://www.mcafee.com/us/downloads/free-tools/index.aspx<br />",

An organization's internal DNS can also be leveraged for this task, such as a None pointer record could be added within a DNS zone for an identified server or application.</li>\n<li>Readily disable access for suspected user or service accounts.</li>\n<li>For suspect file shares (which may be hosting the infection vector), remove access or disable the share path from being accessed by additional systems.</li>\n</ul>\n\nAlso, apply containment measures most appropriate to the type of malware involved:\n<ul>\n<li>Drive-by Downloads - These infections take place when a web site is visited. Ensure browser patches are up to date, as well as any plug-ins and 3rd party tools such as Java and Adobe Reader.</li>\n<li>Trojans, worms, rootkits - Inspect anti-virus logs for malware detection names then perform research on infection data. Follow specific guidelines provided by your anti-virus provider or their website to block suspicious URL's, associated services, and proceed with infection-specific clean up guidelines. </li>\n<li>Backdoors - Examine local and network firewall logs for connections from untrusted or blacklisted URL's. Research your anti-virus vendor's detection name for specifics around connection types. Update firewall and network block lists to prevent future attempts at connections.</li>\n<li>Botnets - Attempt to identify command and control server locations and configure network control points to prevent further communications with malicious IP's or URL's.</li>\n<li>Spam servers - configure email server, spam filters, firewalls and any other network technology to block transmissions of email. Enable the use of spam block lists on your email server.</li>\n<li>Network attacks - Configure DNS servers to use and update DNS block lists (DNSBL) to prevent connections to and from malicious URL's. Configure firewalls and other network mitigation technology to block connections to malicious URL's or IP's. </li>\n<li>Mobile malware - Research infection name in anti-virus logs. Perform clean up routines, or fully wipe the mobile device per vendor specification after data collection is complete. If a malicious file such as an .apk is discovered on the device, use the Artifacts tab for review and further detail.</li>\n</ul>",

Follow-up reports should be kept for a period of time as specified in record retention policies.</p>\n\n<p>The report may contain the following sections:</p>\n<h5>Executive Summary</h5>\nThis section contains a concise but complete high level overview of the incident. \n\n<h5>Findings</h5>\nThis section contains a bulleted list of findings from the incident response investigation. These findings should focus on facts and avoid opinions or speculations. This section gives executives a concise view of the facts surrounding the incident investigations and should include resource and financial costs where quantifiable.\n \n<h5>Recommendations</h5>\nThis section contains a bulleted list of recommendations from the incident response investigation. These recommendations are usually collated and refined by the IR team members and approved by the incident leader. They define all actions recommended as a result of an investigation, including but not limited to, legal action, administrative action, policy changes, acquisition of new tools, configuration changes, and personnel changes.\n\n<h5>Incident Background</h5>\nThis section contains a more detailed description of the event. It is designed to provide a more technical overview of the incident than provided in the Executive Overview. It can cover the current understanding or speculation of items such as scope, motive, and actors.\n\n<h5>Incident Timeline</h5>\nAll investigative reports will include an incident timeline. This section of the report is usually in a table or spreadsheet format. A good timeline gives a precise chronological timeline of all events surrounding the incident.\n\n<h5>Appendix</h5>\nThe appendix section contains relevant charts, photos, diagrams, and other documents related to the investigations. This section provides a recap of the incident investigation.",
