# IBM SOAR Community Applications 

This repository contains the source-code for packaged IBM SOAR Apps.

Many of these apps are available for download from [IBM Security App Exchange](https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/hub/?br=Resilient).
This source code repository may include unpublished versions and additional apps that are not published to App
Exchange. In that scenario you will need to build and install them yourself.


## Developing New Apps

Developing new apps is straightforward using the IBM SOAR SDK.

* A good introduction can be found on the
[IBM SOAR App Developer Guide](https://ibm.biz/soar-docs). On this web page, select your SOAR platform version. On the follow-on page, you can find the App Developerâ€™s Guide by expanding **Apps** in the Table of Contents pane.
* For more advanced documentation on our APIs and available Python libraries, visit our [Python Docs](https://ibm.biz/soar-python-docs).

For questions and discussion, head over to the [IBM SOAR Community](http://ibm.biz/resilientcommunity) where you'll
find blogs, technotes, discussion forums and other useful resources.
