**IBM Security SOAR app for PassiveTotal**

 ![screenshot: main](./doc/screenshots/main.png)

This app uses [RiskIQ PassiveTotal](https://community.riskiq.com/home) to check artifacts with the type DNS Name or IP address and adds a hit if the site is deemed compromised by your predefined definition.

### Key Features
<!--
  List the Key Features of the Integration
-->
*  Checks if a site is compromised against predefined definitions and creates a hit with information on the site.

---

## Requirements
<!--
  List any Requirements 
--> 
* resilient-circuits>=43.0.0



This app supports the IBM Security QRadar SOAR Platform and the IBM Security QRadar SOAR for IBM Cloud Pak for Security.

### SOAR platform
The SOAR platform supports two app deployment mechanisms, App Host and integration server.

If deploying to a SOAR platform with an App Host, the requirements are:
* SOAR platform >= `43.1.49`.
* The app is in a container-based format (available from the AppExchange as a `zip` file).

If deploying to a SOAR platform with an integration server, the requirements are:
* SOAR platform >= `43.1.49`.
* The app is in the older integration format (available from the AppExchange as a `zip` file which contains a `tar.gz` file).
* Integration server is running `resilient-circuits>=43.0.0`.
* If using an API key account, make sure the account provides the following minimum permissions: 
  | Name | Permissions |
  | ---- | ----------- |
  | Org Data | Read |
  | Function | Read |

The following SOAR platform guides provide additional information: 
* _App Host Deployment Guide_: provides installation, configuration, and troubleshooting information, including proxy server settings. 
* _Integration Server Guide_: provides installation, configuration, and troubleshooting information, including proxy server settings.
* _System Administrator Guide_: provides the procedure to install, configure and deploy apps. 

The above guides are available on the IBM Documentation website at [ibm.biz/soar-docs](https://ibm.biz/soar-docs). On this web page, select your SOAR platform version. On the follow-on page, you can find the _App Host Deployment Guide_ or _Integration Server Guide_ by expanding **Apps** in the Table of Contents pane. The System Administrator Guide is available by expanding **System Administrator**.

### Cloud Pak for Security
If you are deploying to IBM Cloud Pak for Security, the requirements are:
* IBM Cloud Pak for Security >= 1.9
* Cloud Pak is configured with an App Host.
* The app is in a container-based format (available from the AppExchange as a `zip` file).

The following Cloud Pak guides provide additional information: 
* _App Host Deployment Guide_: provides installation, configuration, and troubleshooting information, including proxy server settings. From the Table of Contents, select Case Management and Orchestration & Automation > **Orchestration and Automation Apps**.
* _System Administrator Guide_: provides information to install, configure, and deploy apps. From the IBM Cloud Pak for Security IBM Documentation table of contents, select Case Management and Orchestration & Automation > **System administrator**.

These guides are available on the IBM Documentation website at [ibm.biz/cp4s-docs](https://ibm.biz/cp4s-docs). From this web page, select your IBM Cloud Pak for Security version. From the version-specific IBM Documentation page, select Case Management and Orchestration & Automation.

### Proxy Server
The app does support a proxy server.

### Python Environment
Python 3.6 is supported.
Additional package dependencies may exist for each of these packages:
* resilient-circuits>=43.0.0
