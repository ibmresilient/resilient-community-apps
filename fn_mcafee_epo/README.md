## Requirements
<!--
  List any Requirements 
-->
* Resilient platform >= `v35.2.32`

      * Org Data: Read, Edit
      * Function: Read
---

## Installation
* Download the `fn_mcafee_epo.zip`.
* Copy the `.zip` to your Integration Server and SSH into it.
* **Unzip** the package:
  ```
  $ unzip fn_mcafee_epo-x.x.x.zip

  ```
* Import the fn_mcafee_epo **customizations** into the Resilient platform:
  ```
  $ resilient-circuits customize -y -l fn-mcafee-epo
  ```
* Open the config file, scroll to the bottom and edit your fn_mcafee_epo configurations:
  ```

  | **epo_password** | Yes | `<your_epo_password>` | *Enter a description of the config here* |
  | **epo_trust_cert** | Yes | `false` | *Enter a description of the config here* |

* **Save** and **Close** the app.config file.
* [Optional]: Run selftest to test the Integration you configured:
  ```
  $ resilient-circuits selftest -l fn-mcafee-epo
  ```
* **Run** resilient-circuits or restart the Service on Windows/Linux:
  ```
  $ resilient-circuits run
  ```

### Custom Layouts
<!--
  Use this section to provide guidance on where the user should add any custom fields and data tables.
  You may wish to recommend a new incident tab.
  You should save a screenshot "custom_layouts.png" in the doc/screenshots directory and reference it here
-->
* Import the Data Tables and Custom Fields like the screenshot below:

---

## Uninstall
* SSH into your Integration Server.
* **Uninstall** the package:
  ```
  $ pip uninstall fn-mcafee-epo
  ```
* Open the config file, scroll to the [fn_mcafee_epo] section and remove the section or prefix `#` to comment out the section.
* **Save** and **Close** the app.config file.

---

## Troubleshooting
There are several ways to verify the successful operation of a function.

### Resilient Action Status
* When viewing an incident, use the Actions menu to view **Action Status**.
* By default, pending and errors are displayed.
* Modify the filter for actions to also show Completed actions.
* Clicking on an action displays additional information on the progress made or what error occurred.

### Resilient Scripting Log
* A separate log file is available to review scripting errors.
* This is useful when issues occur in the pre-processing or post-processing scripts.
* The default location for this log file is: `/var/log/resilient-scripting/resilient-scripting.log`.

### Resilient Logs
* By default, Resilient logs are retained at `/usr/share/co3/logs`.
* The `client.log` may contain additional information regarding the execution of functions.

### Resilient-Circuits
* The log is controlled in the `.resilient/app.config` file under the section [resilient] and the property `logdir`.
* The default file name is `app.log`.
* Each function will create progress information.
* Failures will show up as errors and may contain python trace statements.
