## Requirements
<!--
  List any Requirements 
-->
This app supports the IBM Resilient SOAR Platform and the IBM Cloud Pak for Security.

### Resilient platform
The Resilient platform supports two app deployment mechanisms, App Host and integration server.

If deploying to a Resilient platform with an App Host, the requirements are:
* Resilient platform >= `36.0.5634`.
* The app is in a container-based format (available from the AppExchange as a `zip` file).

If deploying to a Resilient platform with an integration server, the requirements are:
* Resilient platform >= `36.0.5634`.
* The app is in the older integration format (available from the AppExchange as a `zip` file which contains a `tar.gz` file).
* Integration server is running `resilient_circuits>=30.0.0`.
* If using an API key account, make sure the account provides the following minimum permissions: 
  | Name | Permissions |
  | ---- | ----------- |
  | Org Data | Read |
  | Function | Read |

The following Resilient platform guides provide additional information: 
* _App Host Deployment Guide_: provides installation, configuration, and troubleshooting information, including proxy server settings. 
* _Integration Server Guide_: provides installation, configuration, and troubleshooting information, including proxy server settings.
* _System Administrator Guide_: provides the procedure to install, configure and deploy apps. 

The above guides are available on the IBM Knowledge Center at [ibm.biz/resilient-docs](https://ibm.biz/resilient-docs). On this web page, select your Resilient platform version. On the follow-on page, you can find the _App Host Deployment Guide_ or _Integration Server Guide_ by expanding **Resilient Apps** in the Table of Contents pane. The System Administrator Guide is available by expanding **System Administrator**.

### Cloud Pak for Security
If you are deploying to IBM Cloud Pak for Security, the requirements are:
* IBM Cloud Pak for Security >= 1.4.
* Cloud Pak is configured with an App Host.
* The app is in a container-based format (available from the AppExchange as a `zip` file).

The following Cloud Pak guides provide additional information: 
* _App Host Deployment Guide_: provides installation, configuration, and troubleshooting information, including proxy server settings. From the Table of Contents, select Case Management and Orchestration & Automation > **Orchestration and Automation Apps**.
* _System Administrator Guide_: provides information to install, configure, and deploy apps. From the IBM Cloud Pak for Security Knowledge Center table of contents, select Case Management and Orchestration & Automation > **System administrator**.

These guides are available on the IBM Knowledge Center at [ibm.biz/cp4s-docs](https://ibm.biz/cp4s-docs). From this web page, select your IBM Cloud Pak for Security version. From the version-specific Knowledge Center page, select Case Management and Orchestration & Automation.

### Proxy Server
The app **does/does not** support a proxy server.

## Installation

### Install
* To install or uninstall an App or Integration on the _Resilient platform_, see the documentation at [ibm.biz/resilient-docs](https://ibm.biz/resilient-docs).
* To install or uninstall an App on _IBM Cloud Pak for Security_, see the documentation at [ibm.biz/cp4s-docs](https://ibm.biz/cp4s-docs) and follow the instructions above to navigate to Orchestration and Automation.
