## Release Notes
<!--
  Specify all changes in this release. Do not remove the release 
  notes of a previous release
-->
### v2.0
- Added customizations allowing to find groups that use all of the techniques given
- Added customizations allowing to find groups for each of the techniques given
- Added Workflow/Rule/Data table to get software used by a technique/techniques
- Added support for all of the MITRE's collections
- New column `Collection` was added to technique and tactic data tables 
to specify what collection the technique/task comes from.
- Data returned by the functions has a different format - `pre-processing` and `post-processing` scripts
have examples of what the data looks like.
- Added Activity Fields to the Rules

**Resilient Circuits Components for 'fn_mitre_integration**

 ![screenshot: main](./doc/screenshots/main.png)

MITRE’s TAXII<sup>TM</sup> 2.0 Server provides Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge (ATT&CK or ATTACK) content. 
This content is critical for cyber security industry in order to make a holistic approach to detection and mitigation of Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). 
MITRE Integration Function enables Resilient users to gather ATT&CK information on cyber intrusion once a 
tactic or technique has been identified. This information can help security analyst response quickly to a (potential) breach. 

It comes with a set of customizations allowing to query MITRE ATT&CK for
- Techniques
- Tactics
- Software used in techniques
- Groups using techniques
- Groups that use a specific set of techniques
- Mitigations

## Requirements
<!--
  List any Requirements 
-->
* Resilient platform >= `v32.3.12`
* An Integration Server running `resilient_circuits>=32.0.0`
  * To set up an Integration Server see: [ibm.biz/res-int-server-guide](https://ibm.biz/res-int-server-guide)

---

## Installation
* Download the `fn_mitre_integration.zip`.
* Copy the `.zip` to your Integration Server and SSH into it.
* **Unzip** the package:
  ```
  $ unzip fn_mitre_integration-x.x.x.zip
  ```
* **Change Directory** into the unzipped directory:
  ```
  $ cd fn_mitre_integration-x.x.x
  ```
* **Install** the package:
  ```
  $ pip install fn_mitre_integration-x.x.x.tar.gz
  ```
* Import the fn_mitre_integration **customizations** into the Resilient platform:
  ```
  $ resilient-circuits customize -y -l fn-mitre-integration
  ```
* [Optional]: Run selftest to test the Integration you configured:
  ```
  $ resilient-circuits selftest -l fn-mitre-integration
  ```
* **Run** resilient-circuits or restart the Service on Windows/Linux:
  ```
  $ resilient-circuits run
  ```

### Custom Layouts
<!--
  Use this section to provide guidance on where the user should add any custom fields and data tables.
  You may wish to recommend a new incident tab.
  You should save a screenshot "custom_layouts.png" in the doc/screenshots directory and reference it here
-->
* Import the Data Tables and Custom Fields like the screenshot below:

  ![screenshot: custom_layouts](./doc/screenshots/custom_layouts.png)

---

## Uninstall
* SSH into your Integration Server.
* **Uninstall** the package:
  ```
  $ pip uninstall fn-mitre-integration
  ```

---

## Troubleshooting
There are several ways to verify the successful operation of a function.

### Resilient Action Status
* When viewing an incident, use the Actions menu to view **Action Status**.
* By default, pending and errors are displayed.
* Modify the filter for actions to also show Completed actions.
* Clicking on an action displays additional information on the progress made or what error occurred.

### Resilient Scripting Log
* A separate log file is available to review scripting errors.
* This is useful when issues occur in the pre-processing or post-processing scripts.
* The default location for this log file is: `/var/log/resilient-scripting/resilient-scripting.log`.

### Resilient Logs
* By default, Resilient logs are retained at `/usr/share/co3/logs`.
* The `client.log` may contain additional information regarding the execution of functions.

### Resilient-Circuits
* The log is controlled in the `.resilient/app.config` file under the section [resilient] and the property `logdir`.
* The default file name is `app.log`.
* Each function will create progress information.
* Failures will show up as errors and may contain python trace statements.
