**Resilient Circuits Components for fn_scheduler**

 ![screenshot: main](./doc/screenshots/combined_worflow_activity_fields.png)

This package of functions allows an enterprise to schedule a rule to run in the future associated with a incident, task, artifact, and datatable. Times to run can be specified in the following ways:

1) cron (ex. * 0 * * * for every night at midnight)
2) interval (ex. 5h for every 5 hours)
3) date (ex. 2019/10/23 12:00:00)
4) delta (ex. 1h for one hour in the future)

Schedule rules using `cron` and `interval` are reocurring whereas `date` and `delta` are single event schedules. Scheduled rules are persisted so that restarts of resilient-circuits will resume already scheduled rules.

Functions available include:

1) Scheduling a rule
2) Listing scheduled rules
3) Removing a scheduled rule

## Requirements
<!--
  List any Requirements 
-->
* Resilient platform >= `v33.0.5087`
* An Integration Server running `resilient_circuits>=30.0.0`
  * To set up an Integration Server see: [https://ibm.biz/res-int-server-guide](https://ibm.biz/res-int-server-guide)

---

## Installation
* Download the `fn_scheduler.zip`.
* Copy the `.zip` to your Integration Server and SSH into it.
* **Unzip** the package:
  ```
  $ unzip fn_scheduler-x.x.x.zip
  ```
* **Change Directory** into the unzipped directory:
  ```
  $ cd fn_scheduler-x.x.x
  ```
* **Install** the package:
  ```
  $ pip install fn_scheduler-x.x.x.tar.gz
  ```
* Import the **configurations** into your app.config file:
  ```
  $ resilient-circuits config -u
  ```
* Import the fn_scheduler **customizations** into the Resilient platform:
  ```
  $ resilient-circuits customize -y -l fn-scheduler
  ```
* Open the config file, scroll to the bottom and edit your fn_scheduler configurations:
  ```
  $ nano ~/.resilient/app.config
  ```
  | Config | Required | Example | Description |
  | ------ | :------: | ------- | ----------- |
  | **timezone** | Yes | `utc` | *Specify the timezone (ex. America/New_York) which scheduled rules should follow* |
  | **thread_max** | Yes | `20` | *Number of threads which can run at the same. Typically, triggered rules run for a very short time to kick off a Resilient rule.* |
  | **datastore_dir** | Yes | `` | *Specify a data path and file name for the sqlite persistent datafile (ex. /path/to/scheduler.sqlite)* |

* **Save** and **Close** the app.config file.
* [Optional]: Run selftest to test the Integration you configured:
  ```
  $ resilient-circuits selftest -l fn-scheduler
  ```
* **Run** resilient-circuits or restart the Service on Windows/Linux:
  ```
  $ resilient-circuits run
  ```


---

## Uninstall
* SSH into your Integration Server.
* **Uninstall** the package:
  ```
  $ pip uninstall fn-scheduler
  ```
* Open the config file, scroll to the [fn_scheduler] section and remove the section or prefix `#` to comment out the section.
* **Save** and **Close** the app.config file.

---

## Troubleshooting
There are several ways to verify the successful operation of a function.

### Resilient Action Status
* When viewing an incident, use the Actions menu to view **Action Status**.
* By default, pending and errors are displayed.
* Modify the filter for actions to also show Completed actions.
* Clicking on an action displays additional information on the progress made or what error occurred.

### Resilient Scripting Log
* A separate log file is available to review scripting errors.
* This is useful when issues occur in the pre-processing or post-processing scripts.
* The default location for this log file is: `/var/log/resilient-scripting/resilient-scripting.log`.

### Resilient Logs
* By default, Resilient logs are retained at `/usr/share/co3/logs`.
* The `client.log` may contain additional information regarding the execution of functions.

### Resilient-Circuits
* The log is controlled in the `.resilient/app.config` file under the section [resilient] and the property `logdir`.
* The default file name is `app.log`.
* Each function will create progress information.
* Failures will show up as errors and may contain python trace statements.
