## Troubleshooting & Support
If using the app with an App Host, see the Resilient System Administrator Guide and the App Host Deployment Guide for troubleshooting procedures. You can find these guides on the [IBM Knowledge Center](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSBRUQ), where you can select which version of the Resilient platform you are using.

If using the app with an integration server, see the [Integration Server Guide](https://ibm.biz/res-int-server-guide)
