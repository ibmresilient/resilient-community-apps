**App to handle REST API requests via connector functions**

This app is used executing REST API calls for low code connectors. 
There is no deployment to SOAR; it has no visible functions. The app is automatically deployed to an App Host when a connector is assigned to an App Host.
Then, resilient-circuits receives a message from the `subscription queue` to subscribe the connector's queue to the low_code function to listen for new connector messages.

Messages are dequeued using the `@low_code_function` decorator and results are returned using the `LowCodeResult` data format.

THe low_code function uses the setup.py endpoint `resilient.circuits.background` which allows the code, including pollers, to run in the background without an associated function.

## Requirements
This app supports the IBM Security QRadar SOAR Platform and the IBM Security QRadar SOAR for IBM Cloud Pak for Security.

### SOAR platform
The SOAR platform supports only the App Host/Edge Gateway. Deployment is done automatically by SOAR.

If deploying to a SOAR platform with an App Host, the requirements are:
* SOAR platform >= `51.0.5.0`.

### Cloud Pak for Security
If you are deploying to IBM Cloud Pak for Security, the requirements are:
* IBM Cloud Pak for Security >= `1.10.15`.
* Cloud Pak is configured with an Edge Gateway.
* The app is in a container-based format (available from the AppExchange as a `zip` file).

The following Cloud Pak guides provide additional information:
* _Edge Gateway Deployment Guide_ or _App Host Deployment Guide_: provides installation, configuration, and troubleshooting information, including proxy server settings. From the Table of Contents, select Case Management and Orchestration & Automation > **Orchestration and Automation Apps**.
* _System Administrator Guide_: provides information to install, configure, and deploy apps. From the IBM Cloud Pak for Security IBM Documentation table of contents, select Case Management and Orchestration & Automation > **System administrator**.

These guides are available on the IBM Documentation website at [ibm.biz/cp4s-docs](https://ibm.biz/cp4s-docs). From this web page, select your IBM Cloud Pak for Security version. From the version-specific IBM Documentation page, select Case Management and Orchestration & Automation.

### Proxy Server
The app **does** support a proxy server using the App Host proxy capability.

### Python Environment
When deployed as an app, the app runs on Python 3.12.

Additional package dependencies may exist for each of these packages:
* resilient-circuits>=51.0.5.0

---

## App Configuration
No app configuration (app.config file) required.
 ---

## Troubleshooting & Support
Refer to the documentation listed in the Requirements section for troubleshooting information.
 
### For Support
