## Installation

### App Format

The app .zip file is in a container format and requires a Resilient platform configured with an App Host. 

The app tar.gz file is an extension format and requires a Resilient platform configured with an integration server.

### App Host
For a complete guide on how to configure App Host for Resilient and install apps, please reference the
Resilient Apps [Knowledge Center](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSBRUQ).

#### Environment
The fn_odbc_query App Host container ships with the various ODBC drivers already installed and configured out of the box. 
The only action required is to select the driver that is appropriate for the database you wish to use and include the name 
of that driver in the sql_connection_string parameter in your app.config file. 
Changing the driver parameter to another value results in an error, as the unixODBC driver manager does not recognize 
the name of the driver that you have provided. You may, however, choose to provide the absolute file path to the driver, 
rather than the name. The supported databases, driver names and databases are as follows:

| Database Type | Driver Name | File Path | Example Connection String |
| ------------- | ----------- | --------- | ------------------------- |
| MySQL | [MariaDB ODBC 3.0 Driver] | /usr/lib64/libmaodbc.so |  `sql_connection_string=Driver={MariaDB ODBC 3.0 Driver};Server=domain.example;Port=3306;sql_dialect=MariaDBDialect;DB=resilient;Uid=<user>;Pwd=<password>;` |
| MariaDB | [MariaDB ODBC 3.0 Driver] | /usr/local/lib64/libmaodbc.so |  `sql_connection_string=Driver={MariaDB ODBC 3.0 Driver};Server=domain.example;Port=3306;sql_dialect=MariaDBDialect;DB=resilient;Uid=<user>;Pwd=<password>;` |
| Microsoft SQL Server | [FreeTDS] | /usr/lib64/libtdsodbc.so.0 |  `sql_connection_string=Driver={FreeTDS};Server=domain.example;Port=1433;Database=master;Uid=SA;Pwd=<password>` |
| PostgreSQL | [PostgreSQL] | /usr/local/lib/psqlodbcw.la |  `sql_connection_string=Driver={PostgreSQL};Server=host.docker.internal;Port=5432;Database=postgres;Uid=<user>;Pwd=<password>` |

There are additional parameters than can be included in your connection string, should you need them.
More information about connection strings can be found at http://www.connectionstrings.com.

### Integration Server
If you are using an integration server, please reference the [Integration Server Guide](https://github.com/ibmresilient/resilient-reference/blob/master/developer_guides/Integration%20Server%20Guide.pdf)
for instructions on how to set up your integration server and install packages.

#### Environment
If you already have your integration server set up and configured, here are a few highlights to install fn_odbc_query:

If using the wheel file, install the appropriate file as follows: 

* If using Python 2.7:
    `pip install pyodbc-4.0.25-cp27-cp27m-linux_x86_64.whl`
    
* If using Python 3.6:
    `pip install pyodbc-4.0.25-cp36-cp36m-linux_x86_64.whl`

To install in "development mode," use: 
    `pip install -e ./fn_odbc_query/`
    
The distribution file can be installed using: 
    `pip install fn_odbc_query-<version>.tar.gz`
    
Import the package into the Resilient organization by running: `resilient-circuits customize`

To configure the ODBC Query function parameters, run `resilient-circuits config [-u | -c]`. 
Then edit the `[fn_odbc_query]` template with the connection string and other optional settings.

After installation, load the package: `resilient-circuits run`.

To uninstall,
    `pip uninstall fn_odbc_query`
    
#### ODBC Drivers
When running `fn_odbc_query` on an integration server, you need to install and configure an ODBC driver that is
appropriate for your database.
In addition to pyodbc module, the ODBC function uses an ODBC driver to connect to a data
source. The pyodbc package also communicates with a driver manager, which provides the API
that conforms to the ODBC standard.
ODBC drivers are database-specific and are typically written by the manufacturer of the
database.
The driver manager that pyodbc uses is determined when pyodbc is installed (through the
setup.py script). Since version 3.0.8 (April 2015), pyodbc is precompiled to use the [unixODBC
driver manager](http://www.unixodbc.org/), which must be installed on the integration server.
If you need to change the driver manager, you have to re-install pyodbc.

More information on the pyodbc, driver manager and ODBC drivers is available on the {GitHub
Pyodbc Wiki](https://github.com/mkleehammer/pyodbc/wiki/Drivers-and-Driver-Managers).

Connections to databases are made through the use of connection strings, which are driver specific. General connection string information for most databases is available at
http://www.connectionstrings.com.

### Unicode Configuration
The pyodbc module recommends configuring the ODBC connection's Unicode encoding and
decoding settings that are specific for the chosen database and the version of Python in use.
ODBC Function V1.0.1 supports Unicode settings for MariaDB, PostgreSQL and MySQL
databases using Python 2.7 or 3.6. Recent SQLServer drivers match the pyodbc specification;
therefore, no additional Unicode configuration is necessary.
Users may implement additional support by downloading this function and editing it as shown in
the following figure:

## Function - fn_odbc_query
A function that runs ODBC queries. Parameters are passed to the database separately, protecting against SQL injection attacks.
Inputs:
* sql_query: a SQL query with set parameters using a question mark as a place holder, SQL statements SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE are supported
* sql_condition_value1: value for the question mark - condition value 1
* sql_condition_value2: value for the question mark - condition value 2
* sql_condition_value3: value for the question mark - condition value 3

## Rules
| Rule Name | Object | Workflow Triggered |
| --------- | ------ | ------------------ |
| Example ODBC UPDATE PostgreSQL | artifact | `example_odbc_update_postgresql` |
| Example ODBC DELETE PostgreSQL | artifact | `example_odbc_delete_postgresql` |
| Example ODBC INSERT PostgreSQL | artifact | `example_odbc_insert_postgresql` |
| Example ODBC SELECT PostgreSQL | artifact | `example_odbc_select_postgresql` |

<p>
Each rule will perform the specified operation (UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE, or SELECT) on the database
given the provided artifact value. Note that in the app.config settings the <code>sql_restricted_sql_statements</code> parameter
provides the ability to disallow the specified operation(s) from being performed on the database through the integration.
