# Example: Google Cloud DLP - Inspect Attachment for PII


## Function - Google Cloud DLP: Inspect Content

### API Name
`google_cloud_dlp_inspect_content`

### Function Output Name
`None`

### Pre-Processing Script
```python
inputs.incident_id = incident.id 

# If this workflow has the task_id available, gather it incase we need it.
if task:
  inputs.task_id = task.id
# If this workflow has the attachment_id available, gather it incase we need it.
if attachment:
  inputs.attachment_id = attachment.id

# If this workflow has the artifact_id available, gather it incase we need it.
try: 
  if artifact:
    inputs.artifact_id = artifact.id
except:
  pass
```

### Post-Processing Script
```python
if results.success:
  """Print all the findings as a richtext note. This note may be very long if you run the integration on a large file with lots of PII. In these cases you may want to limit how many findings are put into the note."""
  if results.content['findings'] != None:
    note_text = u"""Findings were found from attachment <b>{}</b><br><br> Findings: <br>""".format(results.content["attachment_name"])
    for finding in results.content['findings']:
      note_text += u"""Text Quote: <b>{}</b>
                      <br> Information Type Suspected: <b>{}</b>
                      <br> Likelihood / Confidence: <b>{}</b><br><br>""".format(finding["quote"],finding["info_type"],finding["likelihood"])
                      
    incident.addNote(helper.createRichText(note_text))
