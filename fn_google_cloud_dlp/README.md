**Resilient Circuits Components for 'fn_google_cloud_dlp'**

 ![screenshot: main](./doc/screenshots/main.png)

The Resilient Integration with Google Cloud DLP provides tools to integrate into your Incident Response Plan. The integration brings Automation and Orchestration capabilities for either identifying, redacting or de-identifying Personally identifiable information (PII) in a body of text.

### Key Features
<!--
  List the Key Features of the Integration
-->
* Inspect a text-based attachment for Personal Identifiable Information
* Search for and redact Personal Identifiable Information from an attachment or artifact

---

## Requirements
<!--
  List any Requirements 
-->
This app supports the IBM Resilient SOAR Platform and the IBM Cloud Pak for Security.

### Resilient platform
The Resilient platform supports two app deployment mechanisms, App Host and integration server.

If deploying to a Resilient platform with an App Host, the requirements are:
* Resilient platform >= `40.0.6554`.
* The app is in a container-based format (available from the AppExchange as a `zip` file).

If deploying to a Resilient platform with an integration server, the requirements are:
* Resilient platform >= `40.0.6554`.
* The app is in the older integration format (available from the AppExchange as a `zip` file which contains a `tar.gz` file).
* Integration server is running `resilient_circuits>=30.0.0`.
* If using an API key account, make sure the account provides the following minimum permissions: 
  | Name | Permissions |
  | ---- | ----------- |
  | Org Data | Read |
  | Function | Read |

The following Resilient platform guides provide additional information: 
* _App Host Deployment Guide_: provides installation, configuration, and troubleshooting information, including proxy server settings. 
* _Integration Server Guide_: provides installation, configuration, and troubleshooting information, including proxy server settings.
* _System Administrator Guide_: provides the procedure to install, configure and deploy apps. 

The above guides are available on the IBM Knowledge Center at [ibm.biz/resilient-docs](https://ibm.biz/resilient-docs). On this web page, select your Resilient platform version. On the follow-on page, you can find the _App Host Deployment Guide_ or _Integration Server Guide_ by expanding **Resilient Apps** in the Table of Contents pane. The System Administrator Guide is available by expanding **System Administrator**.

### Cloud Pak for Security
If you are deploying to IBM Cloud Pak for Security, the requirements are:
* IBM Cloud Pak for Security >= 1.4.
* Cloud Pak is configured with an App Host.
* The app is in a container-based format (available from the AppExchange as a `zip` file).

The following Cloud Pak guides provide additional information: 
* _App Host Deployment Guide_: provides installation, configuration, and troubleshooting information, including proxy server settings. From the Table of Contents, select Case Management and Orchestration & Automation > **Orchestration and Automation Apps**.
* _System Administrator Guide_: provides information to install, configure, and deploy apps. From the IBM Cloud Pak for Security Knowledge Center table of contents, select Case Management and Orchestration & Automation > **System administrator**.

These guides are available on the IBM Knowledge Center at [ibm.biz/cp4s-docs](https://ibm.biz/cp4s-docs). From this web page, select your IBM Cloud Pak for Security version. From the version-specific Knowledge Center page, select Case Management and Orchestration & Automation.

### Authenticating to Google Cloud 


Application Default Credentials:
Application Default Credentials are the prefered way to authenticate when using a client library to interface with Google Cloud.

Services using ADC look for credentials within a GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable. Unless you specifically want to have ADC use other credentials (for example, user credentials), set this environment variable to point to your service account key file.
It is recommended to create a new service or user account with the `DLP.User` permission in the IAM tab. You will then be given a keyfile which you can set as the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS bash value which will be the absolute path to your Keyfile. To use in App Host, create a new file in the "Configuration" tab. Name the file "service_account_key.json" and have the path be "/var/rescircuits". Paste in the contents of your GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS bash value here.

### Proxy Server
The app **does/does not** support a proxy server.

### Python Environment
Both Python 2.7 and Python 3.6 are supported.
Additional package dependencies may exist for each of these packages:
* defusedxml
* google-cloud-dlp>=0.10.0,<2.0.0
* PyPDF2>=1.26.0
* python-docx>=0.8.10
* resilient-lib>=32.0.140
* resilient_circuits>=30.0.0

---

## Installation

### Install
* To install or uninstall an App or Integration on the _Resilient platform_, see the documentation at [ibm.biz/resilient-docs](https://ibm.biz/resilient-docs).
* To install or uninstall an App on _IBM Cloud Pak for Security_, see the documentation at [ibm.biz/cp4s-docs](https://ibm.biz/cp4s-docs) and follow the instructions above to navigate to Orchestration and Automation.

### App Configuration
The following table provides the settings you need to configure the app. These settings are made in the app.config file. See the documentation discussed in the Requirements section for the procedure.

| Config | Required | Example | Description |
| ------ | :------: | ------- | ----------- |
| **gcp_project** | Yes | `<YOUR_GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID>` | *Enter a description of the config here.* |
| **gcp_dlp_masking_char** | Yes | `#` | *Enter a description of the config here.* |
