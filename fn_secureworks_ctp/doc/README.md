## Key Features
<!--
  List the Key Features of the Integration
-->
<p>
The Secureworks Counter Threat Platform (CTP) uses the global visibility gained from gathering and analyzing data from clients all over the world to more accurately identify, contain and eradicate cybersecurity threats. By combining up-to-the-minute threat intelligence with the CTP's machine learning and analytics capabilities, organizations can make faster, more informed decisions about how to predict, prevent, detect, and respond to threat activity.
<p>
CTP is used with the Secureworks SOC team when they find a security issue that needs to be communicated to the customer. The issues can be informational, research-based or require proscriptive actions by the customer. Secureworks CTP provides a “ticket-like” interface that allows you acknowledge, add files and notes, and provide ability to close tickets.   
<p>
The Secureworks CTP integration implements the following functionality in the Resilient platform:

* Poll Secureworks CTP for tickets and create a corresponding incident in the Resilient platform for each ticket.
* Get Secureworks CTP ticket workLogs and attachments and add them as notes and attachments in the corresponding Resilient incident.
* Close a Secureworks CTP ticket when the corresponding Resilient incident is closed.
* Close a Resilient incident when the corresponding Secureworks CTP ticket is closed in Secureworks.
---
## Integration Flow for Ticket Management

<p>
The primary use case for the Secureworks CTP integration with the Resilient platform is to
bring Secureworks CTP tickets of interest into the Resilient platform for further inspection and migitation. Below is a screenshot of a sample Secureworks CTP incident 
with the incident tab displayed:

![screenshot: swcx_close_ticket_incident](./screenshots/scwx_incident.png)

<p> 
Once a Secureworks incidents is resolved, the incident is closed in the Resilient platform by the user via the Actions menu Close Incident item, triggering the close menu popup to appear as depicted below.  Select the Secureworks CTP close code, the Resilient Resolution ID and enter the Resolution Summary.  Once the user clicks OK, the Secureworks CTP Close Ticket automatic rule is activated, starting the Example Secureworks Close Ticket workflow.  The Secureworks CTP close code and the Resolution summary are sent back to Secureworks when the function is activated to close the corresponding Secureworks Ticket in Secureworks. 

<p>
NOTE: The integration uses default Secureworks CTP close codes that appear in the Close Incident popup select input field.  The defaults can be overridden in the app.config by setting close_code parameter.

![screenshot: swcx_close_ticket_popup](./screenshots/scwx_close_ticket_popup.png)

<p>
If the Secureworks ticket is closed in Secureworks portal, the poller detects this in Resilient and closes the corresponding incident.  The poller uses a default jinja template for closing an incident in this case.  The jinja template defines the incident fields and values necessary at incident closure. The user can customize their own template if needed and specify the file location in the template_file_close parameter in the app.config file.  
<p>

---
## Poller
The integration poller runs continuously while the integration is running. 

* The poller creates a Resilient incident for each Secureworks CTP ticket returned matching the search criteria.
* The user can specify which of the following Secureworks CTP ticket types to be searched during polling:
  * SERVICE_REQUEST
  * INCIDENT
  * CHANGE
* The user can specify the following Secureworks CTP ticket groups to searched for during polling:
  * REQUEST
  * CHANGE
  * HEALTH
  * SECURITY
* The poller adds Secureworks CTP ticket workLogs and attachments as incident notes and attachments in the corresponding Resilient incident.
* Poller interval can be set in the app.config to specify how often the integration checks for updated tickets from Secureworks CTP. An interval value of zero will turn off the poller.
* The poller closes a Resilient incident if the corresponding Secureworks ticket is closed in the Securewokrs portal.

---
## Custom Incident Fields
The following custom incident fields are available in the integration and can be viewed on the Secureworks CTP custom layout tab.  The Secureworks CTP Install Guide describes how to create the layout in the Resilient Platform UI.  A jinja template file is used to map the Securework ticket fields to a field in Resilient.  The user can add more fields and customizations using their own jinja escalate template file defined in the app.config template_file_escalate parameter.
<p>

| Resilient custom incident field | Secureworks CTP Ticket field
| ----------------------- | ----------------------|
|scwx_ctp_category | category |
|scwx_ctp_category_class | categoryClass |
|scwx_ctp_category_item | categoryItem |
|scwx_ctp_category_type | categoryType |
|scwx_ctp_close_code | closeCode |
|scwx_ctp_contact_id | contact: id |
|scwx_ctp_contact_name | contact: name |
|scwx_ctp_date_created | dateCreated |
|scwx_ctp_grouping_type | groupingType |
|scwx_ctp_priority | priority |
|scwx_ctp_request_type | requestType |
|scwx_ctp_source | source |
|scwx_ctp_status | status|
|scwx_ctp_ticket_id | ticketId |
|scwx_ctp_ticket_type | ticketType |

<p>
The poller will update custom incident fields in Resilient when Secureworks updates a ticket. 
To update the custom incident fields, the poller renders a default update template that contains the
following Resilient custom incident fields which are the ones mostly to be changed or updated by Secureworks: 
<p>

| Resilient custom incident field | Secureworks CTP Ticket field
| ----------------------- | ----------------------|
|scwx_ctp_contact_id | contact: id |
|scwx_ctp_contact_name | contact: name |
|scwx_ctp_priority | priority |
|scwx_ctp_status | status|

<p>
The user can add more fields and customizations using their own jinja update template file defined in the app.config template_file_update parameter.

<details><summary>Workflows</summary>

The example Secureworks Close Ticket workflow calls the Close Ticket function that closes the associated Secureworks CTP ticket in Secureworks.

  <p>

  ```python
  if results.success:
  noteText = u'Secureworks ticket {0} closed.'.format(results.content['ticketID'])
elif:
  noteText = u'ERROR: unable to close Secureworks CTP ticket {0}.'.format(results.content['ticketID']) 

incident.addNote(noteText)
  ```

<details><summary>Example Rule:</summary>

<p>
The example Secureworks CTP Close Ticket rule is an automatic rule which is activated when an incident is closed that has a Secureworks CTP ticket ID associated with it via the scwx_ctp_ticket_id custom incident field. The automatic rule will not execute if the status of the ticket in Secureworks is Closed or Resolved. The rule automatically initiates the example Close Secureworks Ticket workflow under these conditions as shown in the screenshot:
