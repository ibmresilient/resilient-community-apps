**Resilient Circuits Components for 'fn_cloud_foundry'**

This Resilient function interacts with Cloud Foundry platforms to allow the a Resilient user to manage deployed applications, their instances, and deploy new applications. Managing applications includes: starting/stopping, updating, re-staging, deleting, and getting various types of information about them. This package implements these actions in 3 functions, 3 example workflows and 3 example rules. This package is a wrapper around Cloud Foundryâ€™s API with possibilities to be adjusted for different platform providers.

## Installation

### App Host

All the components for running this integration in a container already exist when using the App Host app.

To install onto the Resilient plaform,

* Navigate to Administrative Settings and then the Apps tab.
* Click the Install button and select the downloaded file: app-fn_cloud_foundry-x.x.x.zip.
* Go to the Configuration tab and edit the app.config file, editing the API information for Cloud Foundry and making any additional setting changes.

  | Config | Required | Example | Description |
  | ------ | :------: | ------- | ----------- |
  | **cf_api_base** | Yes | `https://api.ng.bluemix.net/` | *Base URL for the desired CF cloud provider* |
  | **cf_api_apikey** | Yes | `<your_api_key>` | *Cloud Foundry API key* |
  | **cf_api_username** | Yes | `<username>` | *Cloud Foundry username* |
  | **cf_api_password** | Yes | `<password>` | *Cloud Foundry password* |
  | **http_proxy** | No | `http://proxy.domain:3128` | *Optional proxy setting* |
  | **https_proxy** | No | `https://proxy.domain:3128` | *Optional proxy setting* |

### Integration Server

* Download the `fn_cloud_foundry.zip`.
* Copy the `.zip` to your Integration Server and SSH into it.
* **Unzip** the package:
  ```
  $ unzip fn_cloud_foundry-x.x.x.zip
  ```
* **Change Directory** into the unzipped directory:
  ```
  $ cd fn_cloud_foundry-x.x.x
  ```
* **Install** the package:
  ```
  $ pip install fn_cloud_foundry-x.x.x.tar.gz
  ```
* Import the **configurations** into your app.config file:
  ```
  $ resilient-circuits config -u -l fn-cloud-foundry
  ```
* Import the fn_cloud_foundry **customizations** into the Resilient platform:
  ```
  $ resilient-circuits customize -y -l fn-cloud-foundry
  ```
* Open the config file, scroll to the bottom and edit your fn_cloud_foundry configurations:
  ```
  $ nano ~/.resilient/app.config
  ```
  | Config | Required | Example | Description |
  | ------ | :------: | ------- | ----------- |
  | **cf_api_base** | Yes | `https://api.ng.bluemix.net/` | *Base URL for the desired CF cloud provider* |
  | **cf_api_apikey** | Yes | `<your_api_key>` | *Cloud Foundry API key* |
  | **cf_api_username** | Yes | `<username>` | *Cloud Foundry username* |
  | **cf_api_password** | Yes | `<password>` | *Cloud Foundry password* |
  | **http_proxy** | No | `http://proxy.domain:3128` | *Optional proxy setting* |
  | **https_proxy** | No | `https://proxy.domain:3128` | *Optional proxy setting* |

* **Save** and **Close** the app.config file.
* [Optional]: Run selftest to test the Integration you configured:
  ```
  $ resilient-circuits selftest -l fn-cloud-foundry
  ```
* **Run** resilient-circuits or restart the Service on Windows/Linux:
  ```
  $ resilient-circuits run
  ```


---

## Uninstall
* SSH into your Integration Server.
* **Uninstall** the package:
  ```
  $ pip uninstall fn-cloud-foundry
  ```
* Open the config file, scroll to the [fn_cloud_foundry] section and remove the section or prefix `#` to comment out the section.
* **Save** and **Close** the app.config file.

---

## Troubleshooting
There are several ways to verify the successful operation of a function.

### Resilient Action Status
* When viewing an incident, use the Actions menu to view **Action Status**.
* By default, pending and errors are displayed.
* Modify the filter for actions to also show Completed actions.
* Clicking on an action displays additional information on the progress made or what error occurred.

### Resilient Scripting Log
* A separate log file is available to review scripting errors.
* This is useful when issues occur in the pre-processing or post-processing scripts.
* The default location for this log file is: `/var/log/resilient-scripting/resilient-scripting.log`.

### Resilient Logs
* By default, Resilient logs are retained at `/usr/share/co3/logs`.
* The `client.log` may contain additional information regarding the execution of functions.

### Resilient-Circuits
* The log is controlled in the `.resilient/app.config` file under the section [resilient] and the property `logdir`.
* The default file name is `app.log`.
* Each function will create progress information.
* Failures will show up as errors and may contain python trace statements.
