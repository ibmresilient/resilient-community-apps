Resilient Circuits Components for McAfee publishing to DXL Functions

### Key Features
<!--
  List the Key Features of the Integration
-->
* The McAfee Publish to DXL function contains the ability to publish a synchronous or asynchronous message to an event or a service.
 * The McAfee DXL Subscriber listens on defined topics and maps the data to the Resilient platform to create incidents and artifacts.

---

## Function - McAfee Publish to DXL
A function which takes 4 inputs:

mcafee_topic_name: String of the topic name. ie: /mcafee/service/epo/remote/epo1.
mcafee_dxl_payload: The text of the payload to publish to the topic.
mcafee_publish_method: Specify whether to publish an event or invoke a service.
mcafee_wait_for_response: Specify whether or not to wait for the response. Uses synchronous/asynchronous service.


The function will send the provided message to the provided topic.

| Name | Type | Required | Example | Tooltip |
| ---- | :--: | :------: | ------- | ------- |
| `mcafee_dxl_payload` | `text` | Yes | `-` | The text of the payload to publish to the topic |
| `mcafee_publish_method` | `select` | Yes | `-` | Specify whether to publish an event or invoke a service |
| `mcafee_topic_name` | `text` | Yes | `-` | String of the topic name. ie: /mcafee/service/epo/remote/epo1 |

| (Example) McAfee Publish to DXL (Set TIE Reputation Known Malicious) | incident | `example_mcafee_publish_to_dxl_set_tie_reputation` |
| (Example) McAfee Publish to DXL (Tag System Shut Down) | incident | `example_mcafee_publish_to_dxl_tag_system` |

## DXL Subscriber 

<p>
The DXL subscriber is designed using Resilient Circuits but does not rely on the functions
capabilities. The subscriber connects to the Data Exchange Layer and listens on the topic
specified topic(s). When a message is sent to the topic, the integration uses a mapping template
to map the data into a Resilient incident DTO and create incidents and artifacts within the Resilient
platform. 
<p>
To use the DXL Subscriber, set the topic_listener_on configuration parameter to True.
<p>
When you run Resilient Circuits, the subscriber listens on the default topic,
/mcafee/event/epo/threat/response, and uses the default provided jinja template to map incident and artifact data into the Resilient Platform.

---

## Troubleshooting & Support
If using the app with an App Host, see the Resilient System Administrator Guide and the App Host Deployment Guide for troubleshooting procedures. You can find these guides on the [IBM Knowledge Center](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSBRUQ), where you can select which version of the Resilient platform you are using.

If using the app with an integration server, see the [Integration Server Guide](https://ibm.biz/res-int-server-guide)

### For Support
