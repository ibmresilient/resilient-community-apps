# Resilient Function for Machine Learning v1.1.1

## Description

This function package provides the following feature to be used in a workflow:

Make a prediction of a selected field of a given incident, using a pre-built machine learning model.

In addition, this package contains a command line tool used to build a machine learning model.
Please refer to the User Guide for explanation on building the model and running predictions.

## System Requirements
- Resilient Server version 30 or later
- Ability to connect to Resilient server with HTTPS on port 443 and 65001

## Package Dependencies
- sklearn 0.20.4
- pandas 0.24.2
- numpy 1.16.6
- scipy 1.2.3
- resilient_circuits version 30 or later

## Installation
Install this package with 'pip', or run `python setup.py install`

## Setup
Create app.config by running `resilient-circuits config -c` or update with `resilient-circuits config -u`

The app.config file needs the following configuration values, in addition to those in the appropriate [resilient] section for
connecting to your Resilient platform:

```
[resilient]

[machine_learning_predict]
#   The folder for saved models
model_dir=path to the folder of saved machine learning models you built
```
Use `mkdir` to create a separate folder to hold all the tools used to build, train, and test the machine learning model
as well as hold the models themselves. Specify the path to this folder in app.config file under `model_dir`.

## Customize
Run with: `resilient-circuits customize` to install function definitions and sample workflows to the Resilient server.

## Start
Start this function app with: `resilient-circuits run`

## Build a machine learning model
Use the command line tool
```
res-ml
```
to build a machine learning model.

All the `res-ml` commands should be run from the directory pointed to by `model_dir`. This directory is where all the data and models will live.

The machine learning model options needs to be configured in ml.config. From the `model_dir` directory defined in app.config,
run:

```
res-ml config
```

to create ml.config as well as res-ml.log.

ml.config, will contain the following:

```
[resilient]
host=YOUR_RESILIENT_SERVER
org=ORGANIZATION_TO_USE
email=RESILIENT_LOGIN_USER
password=RESILINET_LOGIN_PASSWORD

[machine_learning]
#
#   Field  to predict
#
prediction=severity_code
#
#   Features to use
#       example: features=confirmed, incident_type_ids, negative_pr_likely
features=list_of_fields_for_features_separated_by_comma
#
#   Algorithms supported:
#       Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Dummy Classifier
#       SVM, SVM with Gaussian kernel, GaussianNB, BernoulliNB, K-Nearest Neighbor
algorithm=Logistic Regression
#
#   Ensemble method is optional, it can be Bagging or Adaptive Boosting (Optional)
#
method=None
#
#   Split samples for testing. 0.5 means 50% of the samples will be used for testing
#
split=0.5

#
# Advanced options
#-----------------
#
#   1. Imbalance Class
#
#   Predicted data could be imbalanced. Uncomment one of the following option
#   to handle it
#
class_weight=balanced
#imbalance_upsampling=true
#
#   2. Data Preparation
#
#   Some prediction values could be misleading for the machine learning model
#   Put those values below. Samples with those values will be removed
#
unwanted_values=None
#
#   3. Filter (Optional)
#
#       * Time filter: format YYYY-mm-dd
#
#time_start=2018-10-01
#time_end=2018-10-08
#
#       * Count: Maximum number of samples to process
#
#max_count = 10000

```
Note that the [resilient] section needs to be filled out and the `features` field that defines which features to use in
building the model also needs to be filled out.

### Download incidents
Enter desired values into ml.config, and download incidents and save them into a CSV file. 
```
res-ml download -o resilient_incidents.csv
```

### Build a model
Using the setings in ml.config to build a machine learning model. 
```
res-ml build -c resilient_incidents.csv -o incident_prediction.ml
```
Note that the sample workflow ml_predict included in this package uses incident_prediction.ml in
the folder specified in the app.config as model_dir. You can modify the name of model to be used in
the input tab of the workflow if you want.

### View a saved model
Use the view command to view a summary of a saved model
```
res-ml view -i incident_prediction.ml
```

### Rebuild a saved model
If you have newly added incidents, and you want to retrain a saved model, you can rebuild it
```
res-ml rebuild -i incident_prediction.ml
```
As a rule, it is recommended that customers rebuild their model once a week.

There are more advanced options. Please refer to the User Guide.
## Uninstall
