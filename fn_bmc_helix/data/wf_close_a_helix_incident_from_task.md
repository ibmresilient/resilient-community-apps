### Pre-Processing Script
```python
# Python 2 compatibility for CP4S 1.6

    if value is None:
        return "null"
    else:

# Use this section to add key, value pairs to send to Helix
# These values will be added/updated on the target Helix incident,
# so they must conform with the "HPD:IncidentInterface_Create" schema
payload = """{"Status_Reason": "foo"}"""

### Post-Processing Script
```python

      noteText += "<p>The following incidents were not able to be closed. Common reasons include that the incident has been previously closed, " \
      "the incident has been deleted, or the payload sent to Helix was incomplete according to the requirements of your specific system:</p>"
