**IBM Security SOAR app for AbuseIPDB'**

 ![screenshot: main](./doc/screenshots/main.png)

This app pulls data from AbuseIPDB (www.abuseipdb.com) and checks if an IP artifact is blacklisted. If so, it will add a hit to the artifact. This app requires an AbuseIPDB account and an v2 api key to work.

### Key Features
<!--
  List the Key Features of the Integration
-->
* The workflow checks the IP address's reputation and creates a hit in the artifact if AbuseIPDB reports that it is an abusive IP address.

---

## Requirements
<!--
  List any Requirements 
--> 
* resilient-circuits>=43.0.0

This app supports the IBM Security QRadar SOAR Platform and the IBM Security QRadar SOAR for IBM Cloud Pak for Security.

### SOAR platform
The SOAR platform supports two app deployment mechanisms, App Host and integration server.

If deploying to a SOAR platform with an App Host, the requirements are:
* SOAR platform >= `43.0.0`.
* The app is in a container-based format (available from the AppExchange as a `zip` file).

If deploying to a SOAR platform with an integration server, the requirements are:
* SOAR platform >= `43.0.0`.
* The app is in the older integration format (available from the AppExchange as a `zip` file which contains a `tar.gz` file).
* Integration server is running `resilient-circuits>=43.0.0`.
* If using an API key account, make sure the account provides the following minimum permissions: 
  | Name | Permissions |
  | ---- | ----------- |
  | Org Data | Read |
  | Function | Read |

The following SOAR platform guides provide additional information: 
* _App Host Deployment Guide_: provides installation, configuration, and troubleshooting information, including proxy server settings. 
* _Integration Server Guide_: provides installation, configuration, and troubleshooting information, including proxy server settings.
* _System Administrator Guide_: provides the procedure to install, configure and deploy apps. 

The above guides are available on the IBM Documentation website at [ibm.biz/soar-docs](https://ibm.biz/soar-docs). On this web page, select your SOAR platform version. On the follow-on page, you can find the _App Host Deployment Guide_ or _Integration Server Guide_ by expanding **Apps** in the Table of Contents pane. The System Administrator Guide is available by expanding **System Administrator**.

### Cloud Pak for Security
If you are deploying to IBM Cloud Pak for Security, the requirements are:
* IBM Cloud Pak for Security >= 1.9
* Cloud Pak is configured with an App Host.
* The app is in a container-based format (available from the AppExchange as a `zip` file).

The following Cloud Pak guides provide additional information: 
* _App Host Deployment Guide_: provides installation, configuration, and troubleshooting information, including proxy server settings. From the Table of Contents, select Case Management and Orchestration & Automation > **Orchestration and Automation Apps**.
* _System Administrator Guide_: provides information to install, configure, and deploy apps. From the IBM Cloud Pak for Security IBM Documentation table of contents, select Case Management and Orchestration & Automation > **System administrator**.

These guides are available on the IBM Documentation website at [ibm.biz/cp4s-docs](https://ibm.biz/cp4s-docs). From this web page, select your IBM Cloud Pak for Security version. From the version-specific IBM Documentation page, select Case Management and Orchestration & Automation.

### Proxy Server
The app does support a proxy server.

### Python Environment
Python 3.6 is supported.
Additional package dependencies may exist for each of these packages:
* resilient-circuits>=43.0.0

### Endpoint Developed With

This app has been implemented using:
| Product Name | Product Version | API URL | API Version |
| ------------ | --------------- | ------- | ----------- |
| AbuseIPDB | ------ | https://api.abuseipdb.com/api/v2/check | v2 |

#### Prerequisites
<!--
List any prerequisites that are needed to use with this endpoint solution. Remove any section that is unnecessary.
-->
* An AbuseIPDB account and a v2 API key

---

## Installation

### Install
* To install or uninstall an App or Integration on the _SOAR platform_, see the documentation at [ibm.biz/soar-docs](https://ibm.biz/soar-docs).
* To install or uninstall an App on _IBM Cloud Pak for Security_, see the documentation at [ibm.biz/cp4s-docs](https://ibm.biz/cp4s-docs) and follow the instructions above to navigate to Orchestration and Automation.

### App Configuration
The following table provides the settings you need to configure the app. These settings are made in the app.config file. See the documentation discussed in the Requirements section for the procedure.

| Config | Required | Example | Description |
| ------ | :------: | ------- | ----------- |
| **abuseipdb_key** | Yes | `[your api key from your AbuseIPDB account]` | -- |
| **abuseipdb_url** | Yes | `https://api.abuseipdb.com/api/v2/check` | -- |
| **ignore_white_listed** | Yes | `True` | -- |


---

## Function - AbuseIPDB
Pulls data from AbuseIPDB (www.abuseipdb.com) and checks if an IP artifact is blacklisted. Needs an AbuseIPDB account and an v2 api key to work. Default is reports from the last 30 days, but can be changed to as many as the last 365 days' reports.
