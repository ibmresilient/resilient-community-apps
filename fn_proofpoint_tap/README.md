## Release Notes
<!--
  Specify all changes in this release. Do not remove the release 
  notes of a previous release
-->
### What's new in this Beta
* Fixed a bug for Get Forensics function when adding a Note the Workflow needed a long time to complete.
* Improved the poller logic and filtering based on score threshold.
* Improved the documentation.
* Renamed the names of Rules and Workflows in Resilient UI for better clarity.
* Updated both jinja2 templates to extract more information from the endpoint.
* Important note if you are using both Proofpoint TAP and TRAP integrations. TAP polls events and TRAP polls incidents, one could be more granular thant the other and you might not need to use both pollers at the same time.

## Overview
<!--
  Provide a high-level description of the function itself and its remote software or application.
  The text below is parsed from the "description" and "long_description" attributes in the setup.py file
-->
Proofpoint Targeted Attack Protection (TAP) helps you stay ahead of attackers with an innovative approach that detects, analyzes and blocks advanced threats before they reach your inbox. This includes ransomware and other advanced email threats delivered through malicious attachments and URLs.

The Proofpoint TAP function package provides the following features:
* Poll detailed information about several types of TAP events in a SIEM-compatible, vendor-neutral format. This includes Blocked or permitted clicks to threats recognized by URL Defense and Blocked or delivered messages that contain threats recognized by URL Defense or Attachment Defense are exposed.
* Get detailed forensic evidences about individual threats or campaigns observed in their environment. These evidences could be used as indicators of compromise to confirm infection on a host, as supplementary data to enrich and correlate against other security intelligence sources, or to orchestrate updates to security endpoints to prevent exposure and infection.

* **Save** and **Close** the app.config file.
* [Optional]: Run selftest to test the Integration you configured:
  ```
  $ resilient-circuits selftest -l fn-proofpoint-tap
  ```
* **Run** resilient-circuits or restart the Service on Windows/Linux:
  ```
  $ resilient-circuits run
  ```

### Custom Layouts
<!--
  Use this section to provide guidance on where the user should add any custom fields and data tables.
  You may wish to recommend a new incident tab.
  You should save a screenshot "custom_layouts.png" in the doc/screenshots directory and reference it here
-->
* There are two custom incident fields Proofpoint Campaign ID and Proofpoint Threat ID that you may show on a desired layout. These two fields get automatically populated by the Proofpoint TAP poller.

---

## Uninstall
* SSH into your Integration Server.
* **Uninstall** the package:
  ```
  $ pip uninstall fn-proofpoint-tap
  ```
* Open the config file, scroll to the [fn_proofpoint_tap] section and remove the section or prefix `#` to comment out the section.
* **Save** and **Close** the app.config file.

---

## Troubleshooting
There are several ways to verify the successful operation of a function.

### Resilient Action Status
* When viewing an incident, use the Actions menu to view **Action Status**.
* By default, pending and errors are displayed.
* Modify the filter for actions to also show Completed actions.
* Clicking on an action displays additional information on the progress made or what error occurred.

### Resilient Scripting Log
* A separate log file is available to review scripting errors.
* This is useful when issues occur in the pre-processing or post-processing scripts.
* The default location for this log file is: `/var/log/resilient-scripting/resilient-scripting.log`.

### Resilient Logs
* By default, Resilient logs are retained at `/usr/share/co3/logs`.
* The `client.log` may contain additional information regarding the execution of functions.

### Resilient-Circuits
* The log is controlled in the `.resilient/app.config` file under the section [resilient] and the property `logdir`.
* The default file name is `app.log`.
* Each function will create progress information.
* Failures will show up as errors and may contain python trace statements.
