## Overview
<!--
  Provide a high-level description of the function itself and its remote software or application.
  The text below is parsed from the "description" and "long_description" attributes in the setup.py file
-->
Proofpoint Targeted Attack Protection (TAP) helps you stay ahead of attackers with an innovative approach that detects, analyzes and blocks advanced threats before they reach your inbox. This includes ransomware and other advanced email threats delivered through malicious attachments and URLs.



 ![screenshot: main](./doc/screenshots/main.png)

### Key Features
<!--
  List the Key Features of the Integration
-->

The Proofpoint TAP function package provides the following features:

* Poll detailed information from several types of TAP events in a SIEM-compatible, vendor-neutral format. This includes Blocked or permitted clicks to threats recognized by URL Defense and Blocked, and delivered messages containing threats recognized by URL Defense or Attachment Defense. Create SOAR cases from polled threat data.
* Get detailed forensic evidences about individual threats or campaigns observed in their environment. These evidences could be used as indicators of compromise to confirm infection on a host, as supplementary data to enrich and correlate against other security intelligence sources, or to orchestrate updates to security endpoints to prevent exposure and infection.
* Pull specific details about campaigns, including their description, the actor, malware family, and techniques associated with the campaign and the threat variants which have been associated with the campaign.

## Requirements
<!--
  List any Requirements 
--> 
This app supports the IBM Security QRadar SOAR Platform and the IBM Security QRadar SOAR for IBM Cloud Pak for Security.

### SOAR platform
The SOAR platform supports two app deployment mechanisms, Edge Gateway (formerly App Host) and integration server.

If deploying to a SOAR platform with an Edge Gateway, the requirements are:
* SOAR platform >= `45.2.0`.
* The app is in a container-based format (available from the AppExchange as a `zip` file).

If deploying to a SOAR platform with an integration server, the requirements are:
* SOAR platform >= `45.2.0`.
* The app is in the older integration format (available from the AppExchange as a `zip` file which contains a `tar.gz` file).
* Integration server is running `resilient_circuits>=49.0.4423`.
* If using an API key account, make sure the account provides the following minimum permissions: 
  | Name | Permissions |
  | ---- | ----------- |
  | Org Data | Read |
  | Function | Read |
  | Incidents | Read, Create |


The following SOAR platform guides provide additional information: 
* _Edge Gateway Deployment Guide_ or _App Host Deployment Guide_: provides installation, configuration, and troubleshooting information, including proxy server settings. 
* _Integration Server Guide_: provides installation, configuration, and troubleshooting information, including proxy server settings.
* _System Administrator Guide_: provides the procedure to install, configure and deploy apps. 

The above guides are available on the IBM Documentation website at [ibm.biz/soar-docs](https://ibm.biz/soar-docs). On this web page, select your SOAR platform version. On the follow-on page, you can find the _Edge Gateway Deployment Guide_, _App Host Deployment Guide_, or _Integration Server Guide_ by expanding **Apps** in the Table of Contents pane. The System Administrator Guide is available by expanding **System Administrator**.

### Cloud Pak for Security
If you are deploying to IBM Cloud Pak for Security, the requirements are:
* IBM Cloud Pak for Security >= `1.8`.
* Cloud Pak is configured with an Edge Gateway.
* The app is in a container-based format (available from the AppExchange as a `zip` file).

The following Cloud Pak guides provide additional information: 
* _Edge Gateway Deployment Guide_ or _App Host Deployment Guide_: provides installation, configuration, and troubleshooting information, including proxy server settings. From the Table of Contents, select Case Management and Orchestration & Automation > **Orchestration and Automation Apps**.
* _System Administrator Guide_: provides information to install, configure, and deploy apps. From the IBM Cloud Pak for Security IBM Documentation table of contents, select Case Management and Orchestration & Automation > **System administrator**.

These guides are available on the IBM Documentation website at [ibm.biz/cp4s-docs](https://ibm.biz/cp4s-docs). From this web page, select your IBM Cloud Pak for Security version. From the version-specific IBM Documentation page, select Case Management and Orchestration & Automation.

### Proxy Server
The app **doest** support a proxy server.

### Python Environment
Python 3.6 and Python 3.9 are supported.
Additional package dependencies may exist for each of these packages:
* resilient-lib
* resilient_circuits>=49.0.4423
