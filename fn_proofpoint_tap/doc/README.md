## Key Features
<!--
  List the Key Features of the Integration
-->
* Poller
* Get Forensics
* Get Campaign
NOTE: If using both Proofpoint TAP and TRAP integrations, TAP polls events and TRAP polls incidents. One could be more granular than the other; therefore, you might not need to use both pollers at the same time.

---

## Poller

Threaded Poller which runs continuously while the integration is running.

* Polls Proofpoint TAP events for all clicks and messages relating to known threats within the specified time period.
* Filters the events based on their classification threat type such as malware, phish, spam, and impostor. The chosen type_filter is defined in the app.config file. 
* Filters the type of events to import based on the respective threat score that is configured in the app.config file.
* Creates incidents in the Resilient platform based on the events.
* Adds artifacts to incidents in the Resilient platform corresponding to Proofpoint TRAP Campaign ID and Threat ID.

The following is an example of an incident created by the Poller.

## Function - Proofpoint TAP Get Forensics
This function pulls detailed forensic evidence about individual threats or campaigns observed in their environment.

 ![screenshot: fn-proofpoint-tap-get-forensics ](./screenshots/get_forensics.png)

<details><summary>Inputs:</summary>
<p>

| Name | Type | Required | Example | Tooltip |
| ---- | :--: | :------: | ------- | ------- |
| `incident_id` | `number` | Yes | `-` | Incident ID |
| `proofpoint_aggregate_flag` | `boolean` | No | `-` | A boolean value, which is false by default. Can optionally be used with the threatId parameter. It cannot be used with the campaignId parameter. If false, returns the aggregate forensics for that specific threat identifier. If true AND the threat has been associated with a campaign, returns the aggregate forensics for the entire campaign. Otherwise, returns the aggregate forensics for the individual threat. |
| `proofpoint_campaign_id` | `text` | No | `-` | A string containing a campaign identifier. |
| `proofpoint_malicious_flag` | `boolean` | No | `-` | Show malicious results only. |
| `proofpoint_threat_id` | `text` | No | `-` | A string containing a threat identifier. |

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Workflows:</summary>
<p>

There are three workflows for this function:

* Example: Proofpoint TAP - Aggregate Forensics for Threat 

Imports additional forensic information based on the given threat identifier. It returns aggregate forensics for the given threat identifier, which is filtered to include malicious results only. Results are saved in a note and attachment.

![screenshot: fn-proofpoint-tap-get-campaign ](./screenshots/Aggregate_Forensics_Threat.png)

*  Example: Proofpoint TAP - Aggregate Forensics by Campaign ID 

Returns aggregate forensics for an entire campaign based on the given campaign identifier. Results are saved in a note and attachment.

![screenshot: fn-proofpoint-tap-get-campaign ](./screenshots/Get_Forensics_CampaignID.png)

* Example: Proofpoint TAP - Aggregate Forensics for Campaign 

Imports additional forensic information based on the given threat identifier. If the threat has been associated with a campaign, it returns aggregate forensics for the entire campaign. Otherwise, it returns aggregate forensics for the individual threat. The returned forensics are filtered to include malicious results only. Results are saved in a note and attachment.

![screenshot: fn-proofpoint-tap-get-campaign ](./screenshots/Aggregate_Forensics_Campaign.png)

The results of all three workflows are saved in a note and an attachment.
![screenshot: fn-proofpoint-tap-get-campaign ](./screenshots/forensics_note.png)

Additionally a script is available for the data table to create an artifact based on chosen row.
