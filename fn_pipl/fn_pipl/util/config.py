# Value between 0 and 1 (float value) The minimum required match score for possible persons to be returned.
# minimum_match 1 will return the information for the chosen person only - the definite match.
# A definite match is best when you need someoneâ€™s contact information or for identity verification.

# Value between 0 and 1 (float value) The minimum acceptable probability for inferred data
# Minimum probability lets you decide if your matches should only include source-validated data 
# (data found in one of pipl data sources) or can include inferred data (data pipl infers based on statistical analysis).
# Setting your minimum probability to 1 means no inferred data will be used to determine a match or be included in matches.
# Setting your minimum probability to 0.7 will include inferred data that has a 70% confidence level or higher.

# True or False, default value is False
# whether the API should return persons made up solely from data inferred by statistical analysis from your search query.
