You must edit the `setup.py` before distribution;
it should contain your actual contact and license information.

To install in "development mode"

    pip install -e ./fn_outbound_email/

After installation, the package will be loaded by `resilient-circuits run`.

To test if login capability is possible for your smtp relay, please run `resilient-circuits selftest`. The integrations can send email without this being functional, if you are using an unauthenticated port (generally 25) behind a firewall. Please be aware that many servers will not afford this capability, as unautheticated senders are considered as highly likely to be spam emailers. They are some limitations to the `smtplib` library which can be explored in your local configuration. 

If you wish to change the mail sender email, please edit the `mail_from` parameter in the code.

To uninstall,

    pip uninstall fn_outbound_email


To package for distribution,

    python ./fn_outbound_email/setup.py sdist

The resulting .tar.gz file can be installed using

    pip install <filename>.tar.gz
