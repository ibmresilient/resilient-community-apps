## Requirements
<!--
  List any Requirements 
-->
This app supports the IBM Resilient SOAR Platform and the IBM Cloud Pak for Security.

### Resilient platform
The Resilient platform supports two app deployment mechanisms, App Host and integration server.

If deploying to a Resilient platform with an App Host, the requirements are:
* Resilient platform >= `37.0.5832`.
* The app is in a container-based format (available from the AppExchange as a `zip` file).

If deploying to a Resilient platform with an integration server, the requirements are:
* Resilient platform >= `37.0.5832`.
* The app is in the older integration format (available from the AppExchange as a `zip` file which contains a `tar.gz` file).
* Integration server is running `resilient_circuits`.
* If using an API key account, make sure the account provides the following minimum permissions: 
    * Org Data: Read and Edit
    * Incident: Read
    * Functions: Read

The following Resilient platform guides provide additional information: 
* _App Host Deployment Guide_: provides installation, configuration, and troubleshooting information, including proxy server settings. 
* _Integration Server Guide_: provides installation, configuration, and troubleshooting information, including proxy server settings.
* _System Administrator Guide_: provides the procedure to install, configure and deploy apps. 

The above guides are available on the IBM Knowledge Center at [ibm.biz/resilient-docs](https://ibm.biz/resilient-docs). On this web page, select your Resilient platform version. On the follow-on page, you can find the _App Host Deployment Guide_ or _Integration Server Guide_ by expanding **Resilient Apps** in the Table of Contents pane. The System Administrator Guide is available by expanding **System Administrator**.

### Cloud Pak for Security
If you are deploying to IBM Cloud Pak for Security, the requirements are:
* IBM Cloud Pak for Security >= 1.4.
* Cloud Pak is configured with an App Host.
* The app is in a container-based format (available from the AppExchange as a `zip` file).

The following Cloud Pak guides provide additional information: 
* _App Host Deployment Guide_: provides installation, configuration, and troubleshooting information, including proxy server settings. From the Table of Contents, select Case Management and Orchestration & Automation > **Orchestration and Automation Apps**.
* _System Administrator Guide_: provides information to install, configure, and deploy apps. From the IBM Cloud Pak for Security Knowledge Center table of contents, select Case Management and Orchestration & Automation > **System administrator**.

These guides are available on the IBM Knowledge Center at [ibm.biz/cp4s-docs](https://ibm.biz/cp4s-docs). From this web page, select your IBM Cloud Pak for Security version. From the version-specific Knowledge Center page, select Case Management and Orchestration & Automation.

### Proxy Server
The app **does not** support a proxy server.

## Troubleshooting & Support

### Common connection issues with TLS and TroubleShooting

Use `resilient-circuits selftest -l fn-outbound-email` to confirm if your connection is successful.
```
fn-outbound-email: 
    SMTP AUTH extension not supported by server.
    selftest: failure, Elapsed time: 0.416000 seconds
```

* Email servers are often restrictive on which applications/users that are authorized to send emails, for instance if you have 2FA authentication enabled on a gmail account, you must add a specific application password or allow less secure apps (Not recommended)

    https://hotter.io/docs/email-accounts/app-password-gmail/

   https://hotter.io/docs/email-accounts/secure-app-gmail/

* Occasionally, mailservers may indicate that emails have been sent successfully (including a successful note on the the associated incident) and yet they be blocked by the receiving mailserver due to insecure spam filters. This is a limitation of SMTP authentication mechanism.

* The port of TLS handshakes may also differ between mailservers (587/2525), a short history of port allocation can be found at:
https://pepipost.com/blog/25-465-587-2525-choose-the-right-smtp-port/

* More info on smtp protocol:

  https://pepipost.com/blog/what-is-smtp

* Some mailservers will not work with this level of authentication/protocal.
