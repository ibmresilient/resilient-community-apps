## Installation

### Installation: New users
* Download the `fn_outbound_email.zip`.
* Copy the `.zip` to your Integration Server and SSH into it.
* **Unzip** the package:
  ```
  $ unzip fn_outbound_email-x.x.x.zip
  ```
* **Change Directory** into the unzipped directory:
  ```
  $ cd fn_outbound_email-x.x.x
  ```
* **Install** the package:
  ```
  $ pip install fn_outbound_email-x.x.x.tar.gz
  ```
* Import the **configurations** into your app.config file:
  ```
  $ resilient-circuits config -u
  ```
* Import the fn_outbound_email **customizations** into the Resilient platform:
  ```
  $ resilient-circuits customize -y -l fn-outbound-email
  ```
* Open the config file, scroll to the bottom and edit your fn_outbound_email configurations:
  ```
  $ nano ~/.resilient/app.config
  ```
  | Config | Required | Example | Description |
  | ------ | :------: | ------- | ----------- |
  | **smtp_server** | Yes | `xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx` | *server IP or smtp.example.com* |
  | **smtp_user** | Yes | `` | *Blank on port 25, login email on 587* |
  | **smtp_password** | Yes | `` | *Blank on port 25, login password on 587/2525* |
  | **smtp_port** | Yes | `25` | *Defaults to unauthenticated, 587/2525 for TLS* |
  | **smtp_conn_timeout** | Yes | `15` | *Time in seconds* |
  | **smtp_ssl_mode** | No | `None` | *Not supported* |
  | **template_file** | No | `data/example_send_email.jinja` | *Optional - Path to a custom template file for formatting HTML email.* |

* **Save** and **Close** the app.config file.
* Run selftest to test the Integration you configured:
  ```
  $ resilient-circuits selftest -l fn-outbound-email
  ```
  
* **Run** resilient-circuits or restart the Service on Windows/Linux:
  ```
  $ resilient-circuits run
  ```

### Installation: Existing Users
* Prior to the steps above, if you have a modified jinja template in use in the preprocessing script, save it offline as a .jinja file
* This file can be specified using the `template_file` parameter, an example template is provided in the `data/` directory, which the integration uses out of the box
* Export the current working state in Adminstrator Settings/ Organization/ Export
* Install the new version in a seperate virtual python environment so you can easy revert

## Common connection issues with TLS and TroubleShooting

```
fn-outbound-email: 
    SMTP AUTH extension not supported by server.
    selftest: failure, Elapsed time: 0.416000 seconds
```

Email servers are often restrictive on which applications/users that are authorized to send emails, for instance if you have 2FA authentication enabled on a gmail account, you must add a specific application password or allow less secure apps (Not recommended)

https://hotter.io/docs/email-accounts/app-password-gmail/

https://hotter.io/docs/email-accounts/secure-app-gmail/

Occasionally, mailservers may indicate that emails have been sent successfully (including a successful note on the the associated incident) and yet they be blocked by the receiving mailserver due to insecure spam filters. This is a limitation of SMTP authentication mechanism.

The port of TLS handshakes may also differ between mailservers (587/2525), a short history of port allocation can be found at:
https://pepipost.com/blog/25-465-587-2525-choose-the-right-smtp-port/

More info on smtp protocol:

https://pepipost.com/blog/what-is-smtp

We cannot guarantee that all mailservers will work with this level of authentication/protocal and cannot support specific mailserver issues for that reason.

## Uninstall
* SSH into your Integration Server.
* **Uninstall** the package:
  ```
  $ pip uninstall fn-outbound-email
  ```
* Open the config file, scroll to the [fn_outbound_email] section and remove the section or prefix `#` to comment out the section.
* **Save** and **Close** the app.config file.

---

## Troubleshooting
There are several ways to verify the successful operation of a function.

### Resilient Action Status
* When viewing an incident, use the Actions menu to view **Action Status**.
* By default, pending and errors are displayed.
* Modify the filter for actions to also show Completed actions.
* Clicking on an action displays additional information on the progress made or what error occurred.

### Resilient Scripting Log
* A separate log file is available to review scripting errors.
* This is useful when issues occur in the pre-processing or post-processing scripts.
* The default location for this log file is: `/var/log/resilient-scripting/resilient-scripting.log`.

### Resilient Logs
* By default, Resilient logs are retained at `/usr/share/co3/logs`.
* The `client.log` may contain additional information regarding the execution of functions.

### Resilient-Circuits
* The log is controlled in the `.resilient/app.config` file under the section [resilient] and the property `logdir`.
* The default file name is `app.log`.
* Each function will create progress information.
* Failures will show up as errors and may contain python trace statements.
