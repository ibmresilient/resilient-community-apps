## Installation (App Host)
With App Host, all the run-time components are pre-built. Perform the following steps to install and configure:
* Download the `app-fn_spamhaus_query-x.x.x.zip`.
* In Resilient navigate to **Adiminstrator Settings > Apps**
* Click the Install button and select the downloaded `app-fn_spamhaus_query-x.x.x.zip`. This will install the associated customizations.
* Once installed, navigate to the app's Configuration tab and edit the app.config file updating the `[resilient]` section as necessary and updating the `[fn_spamhaus_query]` section as necessary.
---

## Installation (Integration Server)
* Download the `app-fn_spamhaus_query.zip`.
* Copy the `.zip` to your Integration Server and SSH into it.
* **Unzip** the package:
  ```
  $ unzip app-fn_spamhaus_query-x.x.x.zip
  ```
* **Change Directory** into the unzipped directory:
  ```
  $ cd fn_spamhaus_query-x.x.x
  ```
* **Install** the package:
  ```
  $ pip install fn_spamhaus_query-x.x.x.tar.gz
  ```
* Import the **configurations** into your app.config file:
  ```
  $ resilient-circuits config -u -l fn-spamhaus-query
  ```
* Import the fn_spamhaus_query **customizations** into the Resilient platform:
  ```
  $ resilient-circuits customize -y -l fn-spamhaus-query
  ```
* Open the config file, scroll to the bottom and edit your fn_spamhaus_query configurations:
  ```
  $ nano ~/.resilient/app.config
  ```
  | Config | Required | Example | Description |
  | ------ | :------: | ------- | ----------- |
  | **spamhaus_wqs_url** | Yes | `https://apibl.spamhaus.net/lookup/v1/` | The endpoint for Spamhaus API |

  | **http_proxy** | Yes | `` | A HTTP proxy |
  | **https_proxy** | Yes | `` | A HTTPS Proxy |

* **Save** and **Close** the app.config file.
* [Optional]: Run selftest to test the Integration you configured:
  ```
  $ resilient-circuits selftest -l fn-spamhaus-query
  ```
* **Run** resilient-circuits or restart the Service on Windows/Linux:
  ```
  $ resilient-circuits run
  ```


---

## Uninstall
* SSH into your Integration Server.
* **Uninstall** the package:
  ```
  $ pip uninstall fn-spamhaus-query
  ```
* Open the config file, scroll to the [fn_spamhaus_query] section and remove the section or prefix `#` to comment out the section.

## Troubleshooting
There are several ways to verify the successful operation of a function.

### Resilient Action Status
* When viewing an incident, use the Actions menu to view **Action Status**.
* By default, pending and errors are displayed.
* Modify the filter for actions to also show Completed actions.
* Clicking on an action displays additional information on the progress made or what error occurred.

### Resilient Scripting Log
* A separate log file is available to review scripting errors.
* This is useful when issues occur in the pre-processing or post-processing scripts.
* The default location for this log file is: `/var/log/resilient-scripting/resilient-scripting.log`.

### Resilient Logs
* By default, Resilient logs are retained at `/usr/share/co3/logs`.
* The `client.log` may contain additional information regarding the execution of functions.

### Resilient-Circuits
* The log is controlled in the `.resilient/app.config` file under the section [resilient] and the property `logdir`.
* The default file name is `app.log`.
* Each function will create progress information.
* Failures will show up as errors and may contain python trace statements.
