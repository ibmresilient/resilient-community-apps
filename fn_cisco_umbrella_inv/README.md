## Environment

This package requires that it is installed on a RHEL platform and that the resilient-circuits application is running.
Install this package with 'pip', or `python setup.py install`.
To set the config values in the app.config file with a new resilient instance run `resilient-circuits config -c`.
To set the config values in the app.config file with an existing resilient instance run `resilient-circuits config -u`.

Config values example:
(Note: The api token will be supplied by Cisco and will be in uuid format)
```
[fn_cisco_umbrella_inv]
base_url=https://investigate.api.umbrella.com/
api_token=abcd1234-a123-123a-123a-123456abcdef
results_limit=200
```

Run with: `resilient-circuits run`.

## fn_cisco_umbrella_inv Example

The umbrella_dns_rr_hist Function requires 2 input parameters. The parameters are setup from a Resilient systems workflow on the Resilient console.
The following are examples of setup of each parameter using a simple workflow pre-processing script. The %param% token
will be replaced by the actual inputs.param value at time of execution.

```
inputs.umbinv_resource = artifact.value
inputs.umbinv_dns_type = "A"
```
For example if artifact.value gets set to an ip address (domain name also supported for this function), the results
returned to Resilient will be in JSON format and will be similar to the following format.
Note: Each Resilient Function will return a different result.
