""" DLP_Incident_Listener is a Component used to poll DLP for Incidents on an recurring interval
Incidents are queried through the Incident and Reporting API and that is handled by the DLPSoapClient class through delagation

Every N seconds, an event is fired which causes a thread to be created, starting the poller
If the poller is still active when the next polling event is fired, the original thread is kept alive.
