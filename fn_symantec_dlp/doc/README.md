## Poller - Symantec DLP Incident Poller

A configurable circuits component which is used to automatically Poll a Symantec DLP instance using a defined interval. 

Interfacing with the Symantec DLP incident and Reporting API, the Poller is able to receive all incidents in a saved report and then import each one into the Resilient platform. As a part of the import, certain artifacts are parsed from the incident object and saved as the appropiate Resilient artifact. 

### Configuration 
In order to configure the Poller to run, an app.config value named `sdlp_should_poller_run` needs to be set to `True`. 

See the README located at the root of the project for information on the app.config values. 

>Note: When the `sdlp_should_search_res` parameter is set to True, the imported incidents from DLP are filtered twice. Once on the resultant list of incidents filtering out those with a non-null `resilient_incident_id` custom attribute. The second filtering occurs if `sdlp_should_search_res` is set to True. In this case, for each incident, a Resilient search API call is performed to ensure no Resilient platform incident exists with the given DLP incident ID set. The search is performed on the `sdlp_incident_id` Resilient Custom Field. This extra filter comes with a performance cost and should be disabled unless needed.

#### A note on the SOAP client and airgapped envionments. 
When setting up the client which will make the SOAP requests to DLP, requests are made to gather the defined namespaces in the WSDL file provided. One of the needed namespaces is [www.xmlmime.com/2005/](www.xmlmime.com/2005) which requires a outside network request. In scenarios where you have Resilient Circuits in an airgapped environment, this can be avoided by downloading the xml file located at [xmlmime](www.xmlmime.com/2005) and then saving it in the data directory of the integration. If this is done, the local xml file will be cached to avoid a network request.

#### Symantec DLP Report Configuration
The Symantec DLP incident and Reporting SOAP API requires that the polled incidents be a part of a DLP Saved Report and this Saved Report ID is specified in the app.config. 

A Saved Report is a way to cluster a number of incidents which match one or more filters. This can be used to pre-configure what sort of incidents should be brought to the Resilient platform. The DLP Filtering tool allows you to prepare a saved report which can simply be for all DLP incidents with a non-null `resilient_incident_id` custom attribute. This will result in an ever shrinking list as the incidents are brought into the Resilient platform. For users targeting a near real-time experience, the above Filtering in addition to a lower polling interval would be recommended.
For an example of how to setup a Saved Report, see the README at the root of this project for a step by step instruction.


## Function - Symantec DLP: Update Incident
A function which is used to update the details of a Symantec DLP incident. It takes one input which is a dictionary of DLP incident attributes to be changed. To enable updates for multiple custom attributes, provide a list or dictionary of all the attributes to be changed in the format: <attribute_name>: <new_value>
