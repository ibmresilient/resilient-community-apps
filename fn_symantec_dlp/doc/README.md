* Update a Symantec DLP Incident via a Resilient Function (unimplemented)

## Poller - Symantec DLP Incident Poller

A configurable circuits component which is used to automatically Poll a Symantec DLP instance using a configurable defined interval. 

Interfacing with the Symantec DLP Incident and Reporting API, the Poller is able to receive all incidents in a saved report and then import each one into Resilient. As a part of the import, certain Artifacts are parsed from the Incident object and saved as the appropiate Resilient Artifact. 

### Configuration 
In order to configure the Poller to run, an app.config value named `sdlp_should_poller_run` needs to be set to `True`. 

See the README located at the root of the project for information on the app.config values. 

>Note: When the `sdlp_should_search_res` is set to True, the important incidents from DLP are filtered twice. Once on the resultant list of incidents filtering out those with a non-null `resilient_incident_id` custom attribute. The second filtering occurs if `sdlp_should_search_res` is set to True and for each Incident. A Resilient search_ex call is performed to ensure no Resilient Incident exists with the given DLP Incident ID set. The search is performed on the `sdlp_incident_id` Resilient Custom Field. This extra filter comes with a performance cost and such be disabled unless needed.

#### Symantec DLP Report Configuration
The Symantec DLP Incident and Reporting SOAP API requires that the polled Incidents be a part of a DLP Saved Report and this Saved Report ID is specified in the app.config. 

A Saved Report is a way to cluster a number of Incidents which match one or more filters. This can be use to pre-configure what sort of Incidents should be brought to Resilient. The DLP Filtering tool allows you to prepare a saved report which can simply be for all DLP Incidents with a non-null `resilient_incident_id` custom attribute. This will result in an ever shrinking list as the Incidents are brought into Resilient. For users targeting a near real-time experience, the above Filtering in addition to a lower polling interval would be recommended.


## Function - Symantec DLP: Update Incident
