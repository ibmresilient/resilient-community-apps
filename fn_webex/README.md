---

## Requirements
This app supports the IBM Security QRadar SOAR Platform and the IBM Security QRadar SOAR for IBM Cloud Pak for Security.

### SOAR platform
The SOAR platform supports two app deployment mechanisms, App Host and integration server.

If deploying to a SOAR platform with an App Host, the requirements are:
* SOAR platform >= `43.1`.
* The app is in a container-based format (available from the AppExchange as a `zip` file).

If deploying to a SOAR platform with an integration server, the requirements are:
* SOAR platform >= `43.1`.
* The app is in the older integration format (available from the AppExchange as a `zip` file which contains a `tar.gz` file).
* Integration server is running `resilient-circuits>=45.0.0`.
* If using an API key account, make sure the account provides the following minimum permissions: 
  
  | Name | Permissions |
  | ---- | ----------- |
  | Org Data | Read |
  | Function | Read |

The following SOAR platform guides provide additional information: 
* _App Host Deployment Guide_: provides installation, configuration, and troubleshooting information, including proxy server settings. 
* _Integration Server Guide_: provides installation, configuration, and troubleshooting information, including proxy server settings.
* _System Administrator Guide_: provides the procedure to install, configure and deploy apps. 

The above guides are available on the IBM Documentation website at [ibm.biz/soar-docs](https://ibm.biz/soar-docs). On this web page, select your SOAR platform version. On the follow-on page, you can find the _App Host Deployment Guide_ or _Integration Server Guide_ by expanding **Apps** in the Table of Contents pane. The System Administrator Guide is available by expanding **System Administrator**.

### Cloud Pak for Security
If you are deploying to IBM Cloud Pak for Security, the requirements are:
* IBM Cloud Pak for Security >= 1.9.
* Cloud Pak is configured with an App Host.
* The app is in a container-based format (available from the AppExchange as a `zip` file).

The following Cloud Pak guides provide additional information: 
* _App Host Deployment Guide_: provides installation, configuration, and troubleshooting information, including proxy server settings. From the Table of Contents, select Case Management and Orchestration & Automation > **Orchestration and Automation Apps**.
* _System Administrator Guide_: provides information to install, configure, and deploy apps. From the IBM Cloud Pak for Security IBM Documentation table of contents, select Case Management and Orchestration & Automation > **System administrator**.

These guides are available on the IBM Documentation website at [ibm.biz/cp4s-docs](https://ibm.biz/cp4s-docs). From this web page, select your IBM Cloud Pak for Security version. From the version-specific IBM Documentation page, select Case Management and Orchestration & Automation.

### Proxy Server
The app **does** support a proxy server.

### Python Environment
Python 3.6 is supported.
Additional package dependencies may exist for each of these packages:
* resilient-circuits>=45.0.0

## Installation

* To install or uninstall an App or Integration on the _SOAR platform_, see the documentation at [ibm.biz/soar-docs](https://ibm.biz/soar-docs).
* To install or uninstall an App on _IBM Cloud Pak for Security_, see the documentation at [ibm.biz/cp4s-docs](https://ibm.biz/cp4s-docs) and follow the instructions above to navigate to Orchestration and Automation.

### Webex Configuration
For this application to perform the above-mentioned functions, a Webex app integration must be created at [Webex Developer](https://developer.webex.com/my-apps/new) using the user's organization account. This Integrations is how the _SOAR platform_ requests permission to invoke the Webex REST API from _SOAR platform_. To do this in a secure way, OAuth 2 standard is used, which allows third-party integrations to get a temporary access token for authenticating API calls. The [OAuth Utilities package](https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/hub/extension/44aaa4fd44c75e22ec979d994ff9948a) developed for IBM SOAR apps is to be used to perform this Authentication.

 ![screenshot: webex-app-integration ](./doc/screenshots/webex-app-integration-sdk.png)

The following steps can be followed to create an app integration:
* Navigate to [Webex Developer](https://developer.webex.com/my-apps/new) and click on *Create an Integration*
* The webesite will then present the user with a series of questions. The three primary field that is required for this integratio to work would be Mobile SDK, Redirect URI and Scopes.
* Select *No* for using Mobile SDk.
* Redirect URI is required for completing the OAuth grant flow. In this case : `https://localhost:8080/callback`
* Scopes define the level of access that your integration requires. All meetings related scopes are to be selected.
* Upon completion, the user will be provided with a Client ID, Client Secret and an OAuth Authorization URL, which is then used for authentication.

 ![screenshot: webex-app-integration ](./doc/screenshots/webex-app-integration-scope.png)

### OAuth Authentication
To establish a secure connection between the Webex integration and  _SOAR platform_, the [OAuth Utilities Documentation](https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/api/hub/extensionsNew/504c896aa38087ba897fa054bc79e598/README.pdf) is to be used. 

* The tool is used to generate a unique *Refresh token*, which is then used by the app.
* There are several ways to generate this *Refresh token* using the OAuth Utilities tool, please refer to the documentation [OAuth Utilities Documentation](https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/api/hub/extensionsNew/504c896aa38087ba897fa054bc79e598/README.pdf)
* Once such method would be using the CLI. A sample command has been provided below:

```
oauth-utils oauth2_generate_refresh_token \
-tu https://webexapis.com/v1/access_token \
-au https://webexapis.com/v1/authorize \
-ci <CLIENT_ID> \
-cs <CLIENT_SECRET> \
-sc "meeting:recordings_read meeting:schedules_read"
```
This generates the required _Refresh Token_ for app configuration.

### App Configuration
The following table provides the settings you need to configure the app. These settings are made in the app.config file. See the documentation discussed in the Requirements section for the procedure.

| Config | Required | Example | Description |
| ------ | :------: | ------- | ----------- |
| **webex_site_url** | Yes | `https://webexapis.com` | Webex endpoint URL |
| **webex_timezone** | Yes | `GMT -05:00` | Reference Timezone for the meeting |
| **client_id** | Yes | `Cf7f235XXXXXXXXXXddXXXX930ae68d377754b971XXXXXXXXX` | Issued while creating the integration |
| **client_secret** | Yes | `dca551c7dXXXX930aeXXXXddXXXX930ae68d54b971XXXXXXXXX` | Issued while creating the integration |
| **refresh_token** | Yes | `mRhMXXXXXXXXXXmNjI53-864e-xxxxxxxxxxx` | Generated using the OAuth Utilities Tool |
| **scope** | Yes | `meeting:schedules_write meeting:schedules_read` | Issued while creating the integration |

## Function - Webex: Create Meeting
A function to schedule meetings or create instant meetings from a task or a incident. This function prompts the user for inputs and schedules meetings in accordance with that.
The user is provided with a certain level of flexibility when it comes to choosing the time or date of the meeting. The user can set a start time or end time, or just provide
the duration of the meeting. The package will automatically determine the start and end time based on these values. Should the user only provide an end time, the start time is
assumed to be 2 mins from current time. If the user only provides a duration, the meeting starts 2 minutes from current time and ends after the specified duration. Note that
the duration of the meeting cannot be set to a value more than 24 hours (1440 minutes).
