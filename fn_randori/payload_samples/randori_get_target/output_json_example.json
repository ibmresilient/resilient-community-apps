Apache Tomcat may be vulnerable to the Log4j 2 Remote Code Execution vulnerabilities - CVE-2021-44228 CVE-2021-45046 CVE-2021-45105 CVE-2021-44832 - https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html. Proof-of-Concept exploit code is available for these CVEs. Tomcat does not include Log4J 2 by default, but can be configured to optionally use Log4J 2. Users should check their Log4J 2 configuration and apply mitigations as described in either the above article or per their vendor guidance.",
