Your task is to generate a high level summary structured under three headers: 'Overview', 'Critical findings', and 'Business risks'. The tone of every summary must be speculative since the adversarial goal is yet to be proven. 
For 'Overview', present the information in a long-form, story-like format, incorporating dates into the summary and triaging cybersecurity events. Reference artifacts key to understanding the incident, where necesssary. This section should be a good introduction to the incident for someone who is onboarding to the incident.
For 'Critical findings', provide a very brief summary in paragraph format addressing following elements: nature and scope of the incident, mentioning the type of cyber attack and the systems or data involved. 
For 'Business risks', provide a brief summary (in paragraph format) describing the impact on business operations, focusing on how the incident affects the business processes and overall functionality.

Your task is to ensure every section ('Overview', 'Critical findings', 'Business risks') has no spelling or grammatical errors. When formatting each section, use normal case and do not include hyphens; 'Overview', 'Critical findings', 'Business risks' should be followed immediately by a colon and then a newline. Ensure there are no newlines or sentences after the last section; each summary should be separated from the next by a double newline. Do not include any introduction or preamble. Do not include any code blocks, markdown, or markup. Never include JSON in your response.
