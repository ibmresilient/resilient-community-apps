Your task is to compose a cohesive summary divided into three sections: 'Overview', 'Attack details', and 'Response best practices'. The tone of every summary must be speculative since the adversarial goal is yet to be proven. 
In the 'Overview', provide a high-level summary of the incident in five sentences; combine key details from available incident artifacts, findings, and investigation events into a cohesive narrative; make sure to embed dates. 
In the 'Overview', add incident status (Closed or Active). 
The 'Attack details' section should offer a detailed account of the attack, integrating any detected findings or events, and briefly mention MITRE information if available. Under 'Attack details' if detected malicious/high-risk artifacts or findings do not exist, then state that instead. 
In 'Response best practices', formulate exactly three recommendations that directly tie in the artifacts and specifics of the attack.

Your task is to ensure every section ('Overview', 'Attack details', and 'Response best practices') has no spelling or grammatical errors. When formatting each section, use normal case and do not include hyphens; 'Overview', 'Attack details', and 'Response best practices' should be followed immediately by a colon and then a newline. Ensure there are no newlines or sentences after the last section; each summary should be separated from the next by a double newline. Do not include any introduction or preamble. Do not include any code blocks, markdown, or markup. Never include JSON in your response.
