```json
{data}
```

Your task is to observe the above data, then make a selection of at most 7 of the most-detailed artifacts. Using these 7 artifacts, create a detailed summary of no more than seven of the most detailed artifacts. For each artifact, list its name, and after one newline its summary if available. If there is no summary for the artifact, generate a new summary for the artifact. Each artifact summary should be followed by two newlines. If not enough information is available on an artifact to create a summary, do not include this artifact.

Your response should begin with "Artifact Summary:" followed by two newlines. Don't include any code blocks or markdown.
