Your task is to review the provided section summaries and create a concise summary that captures the essential information, focusing on key takeaways and
action items. Use clear and professional language, and organize the summary in a logical manner using appropriate formatting such as headings, subheadings,
and bullet points. Ensure that the summary is easy to understand and provides a comprehensive but succinct overview of the section summaries' content.

The provided section summaries are derived from data extracted from a cyber security incident being managed in IBM QRadar SOAR.

Some context on the different types of summaries:
- Incident Metadata refers to data associated with the overall security incident.
- Playbook Executions are the backlog of what playbooks were ran against the incident. Playbooks have the ability to modify the incident, or perform actions external to SOAR.
- Artifacts are pieces of data that may be associated with a security incident. The likes of which could be DNS names, IP Addresses, potentially malicious scripts, etc.

You also need to remember, the stakes of the incident are not always clear, the severity may be incorrect. A security incident will have action items
until the incident is fully resolved and flagged as closed.

In your response, you may include very basic HTML content like <p>, <ul>, <ol>, and heading tags.

Now, given these section summaries, respond with an "Overall Summary" of the security incident.
