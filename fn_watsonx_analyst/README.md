## Overview

**Leverage generative AI with watsonx.ai for artifact scanning, incident summarization and Q&A, and generic watsonx.ai text generation.**

![screenshot: main](./doc/screenshots/main.png)

### Key Features

- Q&A: ask watsonx.ai questions about an incident, artifact, or attachment.
  - Portions of relevant SOAR data will be used in the answer generation process.
  - Prompts can be written in the following languages: English, French, German, Portuguese, Spanish, and Japanese.
    - Responses will then be generated in the given language.
  - The `watsonx.ai Retry Note Conversation` playbook makes it easy to execute the same query again without rewriting it.
    - helpful in comparing results of two models for example.
    - note: changing model in one playbook will not change it for the other.
- Query cost estimation.
  - The estimated cost (in USD cents) is shown in the AI content heading in notes. 
    - Its shown for QnA, scanned artifacts/attachments and summarization.
    - example - `Generation tokens: 78650, Embedding tokens: 54829. Estimated cost: 1.33479 USD cents`
    - **Note**: This is just an estimation based off the understood pricing at time of release of each app version. To get actual token usage and billing information, navigate to the billing page in watsonx.ai or IBM Cloud.
- Artifact and attachment analysis: 
  - Use playbooks to quickly generate a report on an artifact or attachment, as a preliminary assessment.
  - Supported file types include: any plaintext file, `pdf`, `docx`, `xlsx`, `pptx`, `png`, `jpg`, `gif`and `eml`.
    - **Note**: Image files will be converted to text using OCR.
 - Text generation: 
   - Use watsonx.ai to generate text based on a given prompt in a function.
- Incident Summarization: ask watsonx.ai to generate a summary of the incident.
  - Uses Incident data to generate an AI Summary. Two types of summaries are generated:
    - Executive Summary: Generates a high-level overview of a cybersecurity incident, detailing situation, attack, and defense in three sections for executive audiences.
    - Technical Summary: Produces a detailed technical report of a cybersecurity incident, covering overview, artifact analysis, and mitigation actions for incident response teams.
- Guardrails.
  - We have now implemented guardrails to ensure that only queries related to the security domain are covered.

# App usage

## Note Conversation

The *watsonx.ai Note Conversation* playbook allows for incident, artifact, and attachment Q&A

![](doc/screenshots/incident_qna.png)

- This playbook is triggered when a note with the text `@watsonx` is added to an incident.
- By default, this will be an incident Q&A, where incident details, including artifact and attachment **metadata**, are included in context with the user's prompt.
  - Artifact or attachment Q&A can be invoked by including the object's name in square brackets. 
    - Instead of using incident data in context for generating a response, only relevant artifact/attachment data will be included.
    - For attachments, and artifacts with an attached file, the file's  content will be included.
    - Examples of supported file types can be checked in the [What file formats can be scanned?](#what-file-formats-can-be-scanned)
    - E.g., `@watsonx does the artifact [123.sh] seem like it could be used maliciuously?`.
    - E.g., `@watsonx respond with the text in the attachment [incident_overview.png].`.

## Artifact and Attachment Scan

![](doc/screenshots/scan_artifact_action.png)
![](doc/screenshots/scan_artifact_result.png)

The *watsonx.ai Scan Artifact* and *watsonx.ai Scan Attachment* playbooks summarize, and outline potential dangers of file contents.

**This scan is not intended to replace Threat Intelligence sources for performing malware file hash scans**. It's intended use is to be a utility to quickly summarize and assess natural language, and/or code in a document.

#### What file formats can be scanned?
- The app supports plaintext to be extracted from text-based documents (utf-8 and ascii) as well as extracting OCR text from images.
  - This means that any non-text information from an image is disregarded, and if text is not clear, it may not be extracted.

Examples of supported file formats include:
- Document formats: `pdf`, `docx`, `xlsx`, `pptx` and `eml`.
- Image formats: `png`, `jpg`,`gif`.
- Any generic plaintext file with standard text encoding: ascii & utf-8.

## Text Generation

The *watsonx.ai Text Generation* function can be used to roll out your own genAI solutions using playbook logic.

- This function facilitates calls to the Text Generation (`/ml/v1/text/generation?version=2023-05-29`) watsonx.ai API endpoint.
- Playbook logic can act as a force multiplier to create sophisticated AI workflows to perform predefined tasks automatically.

## Incident Summarization

![](doc/screenshots/incident_summarizer_action.png)
![](doc/screenshots/incident_summarizer_selection.png)
![](doc/screenshots/incident_summarizer_result.png)

The *watsonx.ai Summarize Incident* playbooks summarizes the whole incident based on selected summary type.

**This scan is not intended to replace detailed analysis of the security incidents recorded in QRadar SOAR**. It's intended use is to be a utility to summarize and get a precise overview of the incident depending on user type.

#### What type of summaries are available?

- There are two type of summaries avaiable to the users:
  - Executive Summary: Delivers a clear, high-level overview of a cybersecurity incident, tailored for executives and decision-makers to quickly grasp the situation, attack details, and defensive actions. Its concise, formal structure supports strategic planning and communication without requiring technical expertise.
  - Technical Summmary: Provides an in-depth technical report for incident response teams and cybersecurity analysts, detailing the incidentâs technical aspects, artifact analysis, and mitigation steps. Its structured format aids operational teams in investigating, responding to, and preventing future incidents effectively.

# How to get the best out of the app

### Model quality

- Each large language model is different, and perform differently depending on the situation.
- You can switch model at any time at the function level in the Playbook designer for each use-case.
- This can allow you to try out different models hosted by IBM.
- The default IBM granite model performs well, and is very competitively priced.
- Certain topics and use-cases like task-related questions may be better suited for a mistral model.
  - mistralai/mistral-small-3-1-24b-instruct-2503 - very cost efficient
  - mistralai/mistral-large - good reasoning capabilities


### Background on how a note conversation response is generated

- As of version 1.1.0, semantic search is used to find the most relevant data to answer your question from a dataset.
  - Embeddings (semantic representations of text) are generated for queried data.
  - Then, the given prompt is embedded, and the distance between the meaning of your prompt and the meaning of each piece of embedded data is compared.
  - Data that is considered close to the data you are asking for will then be added as context to a call to an LLM with your query.

### Prompting Guide

#### Response Quality

- Quality of response can differ between LLMs specifically when the input context is larger than 4KB limit. There are some models that cannot exceed the limit of 4KB context size.
- Most of the Note Conversation answers are returned in about ~6 seconds. However, it's also important to note that large artifacts would also take more time to process.
- Asking very specific and clearly defined questions can improve the quality of the generated responses. When querying LLMs, it's essential to be as clear and specific as possible about the information or task you want the model to address. This will help the model to generate more accurate and relevant responses.
  - For example, summarizing an incident for a CTO would be a different response than summarizing an incident for a Security analyst.
  - Another example would be if you do not want to include some artifact types in your queries then it should be specifically mentioned.
  - Another example would be finding names of libraries in a python artifact.
  - `@watsonx what python libraries have been imported in [artifact_name.py]? Do not share the code but only the names of the libraries that have been imported. Do not share the methods or functions of those libraries. Generally, libraries are imported with the syntax ```import <library name>`
- If the initial results are unsatisfactory, consider refining your question.
  - You can refine your query by continuing the conversation in replies.
- ![](doc/screenshots/incident_qna_summary.png)

#### Reply chain prompts

- When querying watsonx in a reply note, previous (parent, grandparent, etc.) notes **in the reply chain** will be added to the context, which can help when getting more detail on specific topics.
  - If the previous notes in the reply chain derail the conversation, you can start a new note conversation by creating a new "root" note.

---


# Data selection

You can override the configuration for the data we send to watsonx. While we wouldn't recommend stripping too much from the default configuration, as adding or removing data will likely impact the quality of responses.

## Creating the override config
By creating a `yaml` file under `/var/rescircuits` in the App Configuration page, you can provide an override config, which you can choose to use, for each compatible function (Converse via Notes, and Summarize Incident).

Make sure that the file name is `<yourname>.yaml`, and that the file path is `/var/rescircuits`.

The contents of the default configuration will be below, you can use this as a base config to modify. **Note**: Quality will vary if the config is changed from the default, continue at your own risk, and revert back to default if the data configuration causes a drop in quality.

**Note**: You should restart the app after creating the new payload file, as until then, the app will fallback to default configuration.

## Setting up the dropdown

To be able to use this configuration, we'll have to add and entry to the data config dropdown function input.

- in the Customization settings page, navigate to 'Functions', and click on a watsonx function. 
- click the pencil icon on the right-hand-side of the `fn_watsonx_analyst_data_config` Global Input Field.
- click the 'Add/Edit values' label
- under `default`, add a new config option with the filename of the config without the file extension - e.g., <code>config1.yaml</code> &rarr; <code>config1</code>
- click the checkmark, and hit save
- now you can switch the data config to use on compatible functions in the playbook designer

## Troubleshooting & Support

If any of the actions fail, the following steps may help:
- Check playbook progress on the incident
  - The playbook may have failed. If so, the error message in the function's response may help you interpret the problem.
- Check app logs
  - Download the appsâ logs from Administrator Settings -> Apps page. Go to the details of the app, and click âDownload Logs.â
  - Function invocations will create a request ID, which can be used to identify logs for a specific invocation.
  - Check SOARâs `client.log` log file which may give some extra information.
- If these do not give sufficient information, then you may enable debug level logging for the app by editing the `app.config` and adding `loglevel=DEBUG` inside the `[resilient]` section
 
### For Support
This is a IBM Community provided app. Please search the Community [ibm.biz/soarcommunity](https://ibm.biz/soarcommunity) for assistance.

[^1]: Incident type, artifact/attachment type IDs are substituted with the respective SOAR API name in LLM context.
