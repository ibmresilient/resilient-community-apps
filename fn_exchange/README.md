# Microsoft Exchange Functions

This IBM Resilient Function package can be used to access Microsoft Exchange email and meeting capabilities.
The functions provided have the following capabilities:

* Querying emails
* Deleting queried emails
* Moving queried emails
* Moving the contents of a folder to another folder then deleting the original folder
* Sending emails
* Creating meetings
* Getting mailbox info for a specified user

## To install in *development mode*:

    pip install -e ./fn_exchange/

After installation, the package will be loaded by `resilient-circuits run`.


## To uninstall:

    pip uninstall fn_exchange


## To package for distribution:

    python ./fn_exchange/setup.py sdist

## The resulting .tar.gz file can be installed using:

    pip install <filename>.tar.gz

## Add Microsoft Exchange configuration details to the config file:
    
    resilient-circuits config -u
    
Set the following values in the config file (`app.config`) under the `[fn_exchange]` section:

```
verify_cert=[True|False]
server=example.com
username=domain\username
email=admin@example.com - this is the default account to send emails and create meetings if one was not specified. Specifying an account that is not this one will require impersonation access.
password=password
default_folder_path=Some folder path after root i.e. Top of Information Store/Inbox. Multiple folderpaths must be separated by commas.
```

## How to use the function
Please note that version 31 of Resilient is required to use the example workflows.

        resilient-circuits customize
                
    This creates the following customization components:
    * Action fields and Function inputs:
        *   `exchange_delete_if_no_subfolders`
