## Overview
**IBM SOAR app for text recognition in images**

 ![screenshot: main](./doc/screenshots/main.png) 

An App that introduces OCR functionality to SOAR, which can parse text from images. Uses Tesseract OCR, an open-source package with python bindings, to parse an image and return each line with an attached confidence metric.
About OCR: OCR stands for Optical Character Recognition, and most often refers to the detection of letters, words, and sentences in images. The goal with any OCR is the same: extract the useful chunks of text from an image in an easy-to-read format.

### Key Features
* Parse a picture and return lines with associated average confidence, allowing for automated reading of screenshots and other images
* Accepts different languages and can filter based on a minimum confidence score per line 
* Can parse images from artifacts (see playbook) or directly using a Base64 string 

---

## Requirements
This app supports the IBM Security QRadar SOAR Platform and the IBM Security QRadar SOAR for IBM Cloud Pak for Security.
This app uses a custom build process on the backend which compiles tesseract and dependant libraries from source; this may lead to longer than average installation.
Please keep in mind that this app relies on Tesseract 5.0.1, which is popular open-source OCR. Any limitations found in Tesseract 5.0.1 will similary be present in this app e.g. rotated text cannot be detected if it is shorter than 70 characters.

### Integration Server Installation
If you are running your own integration server (as opposed to using containers), you will need to install Tesseract OCR in your environment. Luckily, Tesseract is popular enough that, more often than not, there are pre-compiled binaries. The pre-compiled packages often come with language packages, but not always. Please see instructions below for installing on your OS, as well as how to add more langauges. 

You can also [build from source](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Compiling.html), although note that you will need to also install or compile [Leptonica](http://www.leptonica.org). You can check the Dockerfile for this app for an example of how to build from scratch, but keep in mind that it is likely you will not need to build any of the image libraries (libpng, libjpeg, libtiff, etc.) on your own local machine, as they are either present or available through `apt`, `yum`, `brew`, etc.

If you build from source, you should add languages manually, by downloading [.traineddata files](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata_fast) and placing them in `/usr/local/share/tessdata`.

For general installation instructions, see [here](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Home.html#binaries).


#### Ubuntu and Debian
See [Ubuntu](https://launchpad.net/~alex-p/+archive/ubuntu/tesseract-ocr-devel), [Debian](https://notesalexp.org/tesseract-ocr/#tesseract_5.x).

To add a language, you can run `sudo apt install tesseract-ocr-{lang}`, where `{lang}` is one of the language codes that can be found [here](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Data-Files-in-different-versions.html).

#### Windows
See [Windows](https://notesalexp.org/tesseract-ocr/#tesseract_5.x). For extra languages, see [here](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki/Install-additional-language-and-script-models)

#### MacOS
For MacOS there is a [brew formula](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/tesseract). There is also a [brew formula](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/tesseract-lang) for extra languages. 

### SOAR platform
The SOAR platform supports two app deployment mechanisms, App Host and integration server.

If deploying to a SOAR platform with an App Host, the requirements are:
* SOAR platform >= `43.1.49`.
* The app is in a container-based format (available from the AppExchange as a `zip` file).

If deploying to a SOAR platform with an integration server, the requirements are:
* SOAR platform >= `43.1.49`.
* The app is in the older integration format (available from the AppExchange as a `zip` file which contains a `tar.gz` file).
* Integration server is running `resilient-circuits>=45.0.0`.
* If using an API key account, make sure the account provides the following minimum permissions: 
  | Name | Permissions |
  | ---- | ----------- |
  | Incidents | Read |
  | Org Data | Read |
  | Function | Read |
  

The following SOAR platform guides provide additional information: 
* _App Host Deployment Guide_: provides installation, configuration, and troubleshooting information, including proxy server settings. 
* _Integration Server Guide_: provides installation, configuration, and troubleshooting information, including proxy server settings.
* _System Administrator Guide_: provides the procedure to install, configure and deploy apps. 

The above guides are available on the IBM Documentation website at [ibm.biz/soar-docs](https://ibm.biz/soar-docs). On this web page, select your SOAR platform version. On the follow-on page, you can find the _App Host Deployment Guide_ or _Integration Server Guide_ by expanding **Apps** in the Table of Contents pane. The System Administrator Guide is available by expanding **System Administrator**.

### Cloud Pak for Security
If you are deploying to IBM Cloud Pak for Security, the requirements are:
* IBM Cloud Pak for Security >= 1.4.
* Cloud Pak is configured with an App Host.
* The app is in a container-based format (available from the AppExchange as a `zip` file).

The following Cloud Pak guides provide additional information: 
* _App Host Deployment Guide_: provides installation, configuration, and troubleshooting information, including proxy server settings. From the Table of Contents, select Case Management and Orchestration & Automation > **Orchestration and Automation Apps**.
* _System Administrator Guide_: provides information to install, configure, and deploy apps. From the IBM Cloud Pak for Security IBM Documentation table of contents, select Case Management and Orchestration & Automation > **System administrator**.

These guides are available on the IBM Documentation website at [ibm.biz/cp4s-docs](https://ibm.biz/cp4s-docs). From this web page, select your IBM Cloud Pak for Security version. From the version-specific IBM Documentation page, select Case Management and Orchestration & Automation.

### Proxy Server
The app **does** support a proxy server.

### Python Environment
Both Python 3.6 and 3.9 are supported

Additional package dependencies may exist for each of these packages:

* opencv-python-headless == 4.5.5.64
* resilient-circuits >= 45.0.0
* numpy >= 1.19
* pandas >= 1.1.5
* pytesseract == 0.3.8

### Endpoint Developed With

This app has been implemented using:
| Product Name | Product Version | API URL | API Version |
| ------------ | --------------- | ------- | ----------- |
|Tesseract OCR | 5.0.1 | None | None |

## Installation

### Install
* To install or uninstall an App or Integration on the _SOAR platform_, see the documentation at [ibm.biz/soar-docs](https://ibm.biz/soar-docs).
* To install or uninstall an App on _IBM Cloud Pak for Security_, see the documentation at [ibm.biz/cp4s-docs](https://ibm.biz/cp4s-docs) and follow the instructions above to navigate to Orchestration and Automation.

## Function - Read Text From Image Bytes
runs OCR on an image in byte string format and returns the relevant results

 ![screenshot: fn-read-text-from-image-bytes ](./doc/screenshots/fn-read-text-from-image-bytes.png) 

<details><summary>Inputs:</summary>
<p>

| Name | Type | Required | Example | Tooltip |
| ---- | :--: | :------: | ------- | ------- |
| `ocr_incident_id` | `number` | Yes | `-` |  incident id, typically incident.id |
| `ocr_artifact_id` | `number` | No | `-` | used for file-based artifacts, typically artifact.id |
| `ocr_attachment_id` | `number` | No | `-` | attachment id, typically attachment.id |
| `ocr_task_id` | `number` | No | `-` | used with task level attachments, typically task.id |
| `ocr_base64` | `text` | No | `ZXhhbXBsZQo=` | When running the function without an artifact or attachment, it is possible to supply an image in base64 format, using inputs.ocr_base64 |
| `ocr_confidence_threshold` | `number` | Yes | `50` | This is the minimum confidence considered before returning a line. Confidence of a line is the average confidence across all words in a line. This value defaults to 50, which means the app will return any line with an average confidence of 50% or more. We recommend a value greater than 80 for sensible results |
| `ocr_language` | `select` | Yes | `eng` | This determines what language Tesseract will look for i.e. if the text is in arabic, we would specify 'ara'. See next toggle heading for a table of languages and their corresponding code. This can always be checked [here](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Data-Files-in-different-versions.html), and the Dockerfile contains steps on how to install your own language |
