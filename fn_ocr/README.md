**Resilient Circuits Components for 'fn_ocr'**

 ![screenshot: main](./doc/screenshots/main.png) 

An App that introduces OCR functionality to SOAR, which can parse text from images. Uses Tesseract OCR, an open-source package with python bindings, to parse an image and return each line with an attached confidence metric.

### Key Features
<!--
  List the Key Features of the Integration
-->
* Parse a picture and return lines with associated average confidence, allowing for automated reading of screenshots and other images
* Accepts different languages and can filter based on a minimum confidence score per line 
* Can parse images from artifacts (see playbook) or directly using a Base64 string 

---

## Requirements
<!--
  List any Requirements 
--> 
This app supports the IBM Security QRadar SOAR Platform and the IBM Security QRadar SOAR for IBM Cloud Pak for Security.
This app uses a custom build process on the backend which compiles tesseract and dependant libraries from source; this may lead to longer than average installation.
Please keep in mind that this app relies on Tesseract 5.0.1, which is popular open-source OCR. Any limitations found in Tesseract 5.0.1 will similary be present in this app e.g. rotated text cannot be detected if it is shorter than 70 characters.

### SOAR platform
The SOAR platform supports two app deployment mechanisms, App Host and integration server.

If deploying to a SOAR platform with an App Host, the requirements are:
* SOAR platform >= `45.0.7899`.
* The app is in a container-based format (available from the AppExchange as a `zip` file).

If deploying to a SOAR platform with an integration server, the requirements are:
* SOAR platform >= `45.0.7899`.
* The app is in the older integration format (available from the AppExchange as a `zip` file which contains a `tar.gz` file).
* Integration server is running `resilient-circuits>=45.0.0`.
* If using an API key account, make sure the account provides the following minimum permissions: 
  | Name | Permissions |
  | ---- | ----------- |
  | Incidents | Read |
  | Org Data | Read |
  | Function | Read |
  

The following SOAR platform guides provide additional information: 
* _App Host Deployment Guide_: provides installation, configuration, and troubleshooting information, including proxy server settings. 
* _Integration Server Guide_: provides installation, configuration, and troubleshooting information, including proxy server settings.
* _System Administrator Guide_: provides the procedure to install, configure and deploy apps. 

The above guides are available on the IBM Documentation website at [ibm.biz/soar-docs](https://ibm.biz/soar-docs). On this web page, select your SOAR platform version. On the follow-on page, you can find the _App Host Deployment Guide_ or _Integration Server Guide_ by expanding **Apps** in the Table of Contents pane. The System Administrator Guide is available by expanding **System Administrator**.

### Cloud Pak for Security
If you are deploying to IBM Cloud Pak for Security, the requirements are:
* IBM Cloud Pak for Security >= 1.4.
* Cloud Pak is configured with an App Host.
* The app is in a container-based format (available from the AppExchange as a `zip` file).

The following Cloud Pak guides provide additional information: 
* _App Host Deployment Guide_: provides installation, configuration, and troubleshooting information, including proxy server settings. From the Table of Contents, select Case Management and Orchestration & Automation > **Orchestration and Automation Apps**.
* _System Administrator Guide_: provides information to install, configure, and deploy apps. From the IBM Cloud Pak for Security IBM Documentation table of contents, select Case Management and Orchestration & Automation > **System administrator**.

These guides are available on the IBM Documentation website at [ibm.biz/cp4s-docs](https://ibm.biz/cp4s-docs). From this web page, select your IBM Cloud Pak for Security version. From the version-specific IBM Documentation page, select Case Management and Orchestration & Automation.

### Proxy Server
The app **does** support a proxy server.

### Python Environment
Both Python 2.7 and Python 3.6 are supported.
Additional package dependencies may exist for each of these packages:

* opencv-python-headless==4.5.5.64
* resilient-circuits>=45.0.0

For Python 3.6 
* numpy == 1.19
* pandas == 1.1.5
* pytesseract == 0.3.8

For Python 3.9
* numpy==1.22
* pandas==1.4.2
* pytesseract==0.3.9
