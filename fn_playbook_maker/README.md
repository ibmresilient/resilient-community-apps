## Overview
<!--
  Provide a high-level description of the function itself and its remote software or application.

**Generate playbooks from function definitions for fast prototyping or business processing **

 ![screenshot: main](./doc/screenshots/main.png)

This app gives you the ability quickly generate a complete playbook from functions to use in your business processing or to quickly prototype playbook access.
Given that many apps are not distributed with example rules/workflows or playbooks, this capability is a fast way to get started with the use of a function.

Specify an app to include all it's functions in playbooks, or name the functions individually to create playbooks as a starting point for playbook creation. The resulting playbooks have the necessary 'bones' to execute a function and process it's output. Some work remains to fill out the logic to process the function's output.

### Key Features
<!--
  List the Key Features of the Integration
-->
* Generate one playbook with all functions or separate each function in it's own playbook.
* Specify whether the playbook is used automatically or manually.
* Specify whether the playbook should include activation fields for manual playbooks.
* Auto generate a processing script for function output or use existing global scripts.

All playbooks are generated in `Draft` mode, so that additional changes can be made. Once complete (such as adding execution conditions or output script parsing logic), enable the playbook for use with incidents, artifacts, attachments, etc.

Create playbook(s) based on specific apps and functions.

 ![screenshot: fn-make-playbook ](./doc/screenshots/fn-make-playbook.png)

<details><summary>Inputs:</summary>
<p>

| Name | Type | Required | Example | Tooltip |
| ---- | :--: | :------: | ------- | ------- |
| `pbm_playbook_type` | `text` | Yes | `-` | incident, artifact, attachment, comment, <datatable name>. Note: In order to specify datatable names, edit the Rule Activity Field: `pbm_playbook_type` to include your datatable name(s) |
| `pbm_playbook_name` | `text` | Yes | `Playbook for <function>` | Name of playbook to create. `pbm_add_to_same_playbook` = Yes, then this will become the playbook name. If `pbm_add_to_same_playbook` = No, it will become a prefix appended with the associated function included. Names should be contain alphanumberic, blank and dash or underscore characters |
| `pbm_app_name` | `text` | No | `-` | Name of app to associate to playbook(s). Either specify `pbm_app_name` or `pbm_function_names` but not both. |
| `pbm_function_names` | `text` | No | `fuction1,function2` | Comma separated names of functions or blank for all functions when using `pbm_app_name`  |
| `pbm_script_names` | `text` | No | `script1,script2` | Comma separated list of scripts to apply. Use 'local' to generate a local script. If this field is empty, local script(s) are added to all function(s). |
| `pbm_add_to_same_playbook` | `boolean` | No | `-` | If Yes, all function(s) are added to one playbook. |
| `pbm_activation_type` | `select` | Yes | `-` | 'Automatic' or 'Manual' |
| `pbm_activation_fields` | `boolean` | Yes | `-` | Create activation fields for data input. This is only valid when  `pbm_activation_type` = "Manual". |


Notes: When selecting `pbm_add_to_same_playbook=Yes` and `pbm_activation_fields=Yes`, only the first function will use activation fields. This restriction is due to overlapping activation fields which becomes confusing for the functions specified after the first.

```

### Function Inputs without Activation Fields
If activation fields are not created with the playbook, a skeleton of the input field assignments is created. You will need to make the assignments necessary by changing the `<CHANGE>` references. Below is a snippet of what the skeleton script looks like:

  ![screenshot: fn-make-playbook ](./doc/screenshots/default_input_script.png)



Sample Input script:
```
# (text) Required: No. Comma separated list of incident attachments
inputs.mail_attachments= <CHANGE>

# (text) Required: No
inputs.mail_bcc= <CHANGE>

# (text) Required: No
inputs.mail_body_html= <CHANGE>
```

### Function Inputs with Activation Fields
When activation fields are created, the function's input script will create an activation field for each function input field. Then, each activation field is associated with the corresponding function input field as follow:

```
# (text) Required: Yes. The unique identifiers of devices included in the request
inputs.absolute_resilience_device= playbook.inputs.absolute_resilience_device

# (boolean) Required: Yes. Specifies if the list of devices are serial numbers (default is ESN's) Can be omitted if using ESN
inputs.absolute_resilience_is_serial_number= playbook.inputs.absolute_resilience_is_serial_number
```

You're use of this playbook may source function data differently, such as from the incident (incident.properties.<custom field>) or from the artifact (artifact.value). Feel free to remove unnecessary activation fields and modify the input script to reference the appropriate data assignments.

  ![screenshot: fn-make-playbook ](./doc/screenshots/activation_fields.png)

### Local Post-processing Script
When a local post-processing script is generated. It's just a shell of the logic needed to parse the function's results. The script collects the properties of the function output (ie playbook.functions.results.<function name>). You will need to edit the script to parse the function's results by replacing the content at `<CHANGE>`. Here's the content of the script:

```
content = playbook.functions.results.send_email
if content.success:
  # change to include your parsing logic
  <CHANGE>
else:
  incident.addNote("Failed: {}".format(content.reason))
```

  ![screenshot: fn-make-playbook ](./doc/screenshots/local_script.png)

### Using Global Scripts
Global scripts can be used when referenced in the `pbm_script_names` function input field.  When specified, they are added into a playbook for function output processing.
Be aware that you'll need to modify the script to access the function's output located at `playbook.functions.results.<function_api_name>`.
You can clone a script if you wish a private copy with this function output location.

## Rules
| Rule Name | Object | Workflow Triggered |
| --------- | ------ | ------------------ |
| Playbook Maker | incident | `playbook_maker` |

Note: In order to create playbooks for datatables, edit the rule `Playbook Maker` with the `pbm_playbook_type` activity field and change the reference `<change for datatables>` to your custom datatable API name(s).
